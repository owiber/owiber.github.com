I'm Oliver Wong and this is my humble blog.  I went to [UT Austin](http://www.utexas.edu) and graduated with a Computer Science degree.  I am currently happily employed at <del>[Bazaarvoice](http://www.bazaarvoice.com)</del> <del>[Mass Relevance](http://www.massrelevance.com)</del> <del>[Spredfast](http://www.spredfast.com)</del> [Stripe](http://stripe.com).  I enjoy [photography](http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber), hanging out with friends, playing video games, web design and other similarly nerdy things. =)  My usual online alias is "Owiber" and I don't remember how I came up with that, but it's pretty convenient.

I'm pretty easy-going most of the time.  In high school, my English teacher told me to read out a passage (perhaps from a poem, I can't remember), which I did, but then she requested I do it again because I wasn't "angry enough."  I responded with "Ms. K, I'm not a very angry person" which made the whole class laugh because they knew it was true.  There are, however, certain topics that will annoy me quite a bit, but I won't go into those here for fear of them being used against me... ;-)

<del>I play WoW with my friends and have a shaman with parents who named him while drunk on some stolen dwarven ale, [Herthumpus](http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Laughing+Skull&n=Herthumpus) and an albino druid who aspires to be famous like Bono: [Albono](http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Laughing+Skull&n=Albono).
</del>

I'm on the usual social networking sites, primarily driven out of boredom (except for flickr, which I generally enjoy using regardless).  You can find me there here:

I have a habit of making mock sites dealing with my roommates.  On Xanga, I live an alternate life of heart brokenness after the many years of abuse from my college roommate, [Sam Ni](http://sammaverick.com).  [Xanga Owiber](http://owiber.xanga.com) has gone through various phases in his sad life and is currently on a goth streak as far as I can tell, but has been rather silent as of late.  I also maintain a _very popular_ *cough* reporting site, [AndrewApproved.com](http://www.andrewapproved.com) which is dedicated to my dear friend Andrew Joseph and all things that he _loves loves loves_.  Finally, I created a Twitter account for my current roomy: [JRyanFunSponge](http://twitter.com/jryanfunsponge) (updated by others in addition to myself).

"About Me" pages have gone through various iterations in my online timeline, here're a few old ones:

From [MrTechHappy](http://www.mrtechhappy.com) (~2002):


<blockquote>"Oliver Wong is currently a Computer Science major at the University of Texas at Austin and likes to call his major, "Counter-Strike." Having not a great deal of school pride, even in college, he is semi-phobic of swarms of orange which sometimes spring up from nowhere on weekends during the Fall semester. He's the webdesigner and coder for MrTechHappy and has also been doing a majority of the artwork for the comics, basing them off of Brook's original concepts."</blockquote>


In my high school days, I used to be involved in various gaming fan sites, primarily focused around Command & Conquer games (specifically Tiberian Sun, which I think sucked when it actually came out... sigh).  Someone I "worked" with wrote [this about me](http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/olivetti.shtml).

I enjoy nostalgic things - movies, songs, etc. probably because I have been blessed with a wonderful life thus far.  I consider myself a "memory pack-rat" and will occasionally go back and hunt through my digital archives and read old chat logs, browse old websites, view old photos, etc.  I have a group of friends that have roots going back to middle school, which I am incredibly happy to have, a family that includes two sisters and a mom who are very loud, but I love regardless, and coworkers who I also very much like but am fond of pulling the "well, I'm hanging out with _my friends_ tonight" card in a teasing manner.

My music taste plays to my affection for nostalgia and I enjoy much of the 80's.  I am also very fond of ridiculous love songs spanning the past few decades which I find ironic, but that also makes it more fun (much like my endearing thoughts on the color pink).

I'm overall somewhat on the shy side in real life, but I tend to open up a bit more online, so I hear.  I enjoy group events, but also the occasional solo-time with a good friend.  Usually perfectly fine with sitting in silence and/or people watching with the right company.  My favorite movie is Transformers:

I'm single (as of this writing, at least), and not actively searching, but it's been thought that I will meet my dream girl on a park bench as I solved my rubik's cube... so if you see me frequenting public parks toting the iconic nerd puzzle in hand, I just might be searching again.

I think I've written way way way too much about myself now, so... cowabunga, dude.
