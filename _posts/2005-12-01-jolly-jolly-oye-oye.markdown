Oye!  It's December already!  Other than rent being due, this means you will hear the Christmas tunes everytime you enter a retail store (actually, that started after Thanksgiving, but oh well).  This month also marks some birthdays and the return of Andrew.

I need to figure out when to spend my PTO (paid time off).  When are we doing stuff, dudes? =)
