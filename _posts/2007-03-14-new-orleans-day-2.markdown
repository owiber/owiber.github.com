Today we went to clean up a city park that had gotten flooded and overrun by weeds.  All the plants that used to be there were wiped out as well as the trails and everything.  Apparently people used to run/bike the trails, which reminded me of Town Lake in Austin.  We had to clear a bunch of the wild vegetation that grew (weeds, vines, etc.) and hack away at trees/branches that were on the ground.

Here're some pics:

For dinner, I had some lamb chops at a Lebanese place.  It was awesome.
