So Andrew says the "no jeans" thing is my trademark, and I guess it kinda is, but it is time to move on I suppose, haha.   I realized that I never once wore a pair of jeans while I was at UT, and I wore them almost exclusively in high school until I switched entirely to khakis.  And... I never really had a solid reason <i>why</i> I decided to do so.  So I guess now I'll wear both...

This is my public announcement that I am now wearing jeans and will accept pairs gifted to me that fit. Haha. =)  Kathy got me pair for my birthday (early) and the girls apparently are happy...<blockquote>Oriana: GAUGAU
Oriana: IN JEANS
Oriana: YAY</blockquote>

Ran again today!  Keeping up the streak... I'll work my way up to 5k eventually... any other lifestyle changes I should be making while I'm at it? Haha...

Well darn, my right Sony headphones just died on me and are muted... stinky... I wonder if I can still get them replaced under warranty if I don't have the box nor the receipt anymore...
