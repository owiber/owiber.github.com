Yesterday, I went to shoot some photos for JM with Kathy, Sam and Van.  I think this time went much better than last (the lighting helped... yay for dusk).  After that Kathy, Nathan, Sam and I went to Chili's and hung out for a while... was reminiscent of dorm room days when Nathan would spend the night... haha, good times. =)  If only Paul were around too...

Running those three miles around Town Lake is getting easier, yay!  Yesterday, it felt like my left foot fell asleep at the end of the run... is that bad?  That doesn't sound good... hmm... well, all went well today though and my foot was awake and alive.  Speaking of "foot"... I mentioned the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/teenagemutantninjaturtles/">TMNT teaser</a> to my coworkers yesterday and man... I'm pumped up about this movie.  Cowabunga, dudes!
