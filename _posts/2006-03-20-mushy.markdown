This definitely has been one of, if not the best, spring breaks I've ever had (even though I didn't really have a SB this year - yay PTO! ;).  Despite having graduated last year, this coming year has more of the "graduation" feeling to it because many of you all are the ones graduating.  I feel like our lives will have a more drastic change after this semester ends and more of us move into the "working world."  Where ever God sends you all in the next few months, I'm happy to call each and every one of you my friends.  This was the last SB for a lot of you, thanks for sharing it with me. =)
