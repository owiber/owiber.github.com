First off, I just found out why my scanner was scanning in pictures weird. I thought it was just that it was cheap. It's actually because I never calibrated it. Doh. Doh. Doh! Anyways, the calibrated scanner scanned four of the new pics (the ones on page <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/23/index.shtml">23</a>). I've added three pages for now, pages <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/21/index.shtml">21</a> to 23. Enjoy! =) And yes, there will be more later when I get the pictures from Amanda's camera and your cameras...<br /><br />-Oliver
