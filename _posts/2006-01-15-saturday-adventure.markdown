Aaron, Sam, Van and I went to take pictures of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffy-Shamrock_Joint_Venture_Tower">Duffy-Shamrock Joint Venture Tower</a> which is almost 2000 feet (over a third of a mile) high.  For comparison, Tapei 101 is almost 1700 feet tall.  I've got pictures on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber">flickr</a>, but that's not what I really want to talk about right now.

So before we set out on our journey, I stopped by a Shell station to fill up on gas.  There were these two young girls in an Eclipse using the pump in front of me.  As I sat back down in my car after starting to fill my tank, I look up to see the girls start to drive away with the gas pump still connected to the car.  Needless to say, it jerked off of the car, making a clanging noise and flung away a few yards.  There were about three or four guys who saw all this occur and within seconds we all gave each other a somewhat amused look as if we all had affirmed every negative female driver stereotype there was possible, especially young ones that were given a sports car from their daddy. =P

The girl quickly got out of her car, closed the little door to her gas tank and sped off.  She didn't even go pick up the gas pump that was not lying on the ground.  Girls these days.  lol
