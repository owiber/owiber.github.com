I slept in a lot this weekend.  It was awesome. Here's the rundown:
<ul>
<li>Slept until around 3PM on both Saturday and Sunday</li>
<li>At at Madam Mam's with Sam, TC, and Ryan (got dessert at Chez Zee afterwards)</li>
<li>Played lots of Starcraft 2 (got gold in all the challenges)</li>
<li>I got a new Google Voice number to use with Melissa... I got 5**-XKCD =)</li>
<li>I think I might have played some DotA, but I'm not sure... haha... no, I think I did</li>
<li>Skyped with Melissa after she moved into her dorm</li>
</ul>
