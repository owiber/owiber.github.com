Yes, I turned 27 over the past weekend.  I didn't really do much though... mostly sat around and read.  There was some eating involved, though.  On Friday, the usual gang went to Austin Land & Cattle, Saturday, I went to Asia Cafe with the family.  Then finally on Sunday, Heather arranged for a small birthday thingy with a few peeps at Eddie V's, then we went to a couple of coffee shops until we found one that was open and not packed.

Did something else happen?  I can't remember anymore... oh, I have cancelled my WoW account and we played Heroes of Newerth instead last night.

Oh yeah, and Melissa made me a website in the fashion of <a href="http://www.andrewapproved.com">Andrew Approved</a>: <a href="http://owiberwuvs.tumblr.com/">Things Owiber Wuvs!</a>
