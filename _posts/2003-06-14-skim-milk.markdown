I wanted some milk to go with the banana bread Oriana made (she's awesome! it's good stuff =)... but the only thing in the fridge was skim milk!!! That's MILK FLAVORED WATER! I hate that stuff.  So... to spite the whole "no fat" thing, I poured myself a glass, took out some half and half and drenched that thing with nice creamy fat.<br /><br />Yum.<br /><br />-Oliver
