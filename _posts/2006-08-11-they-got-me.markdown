I went to Olivia's to use her microwave, eat some food, play with the dog, etc. etc... and she finally got that darned <a href="http://psc.disney.go.com/disneychannel/originalmovies/highschoolmusical/">High School Musical</a> <a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/highschoolmusical/whativebeenlookingfor.htm">song</a> stuck in my head.

I must say it is rather catchy and similar to a lot of other songs I own... just that it being one of those "Disney original movies" rubs me the wrong way. =)

<i>"This feeling's like no other
I want you to know
I've never had someone that knows me like you do
The way you do
I've never had someone as good for me as you
No one like you
So lonely before, I finally found
what I've been looking for..."</i> - High School Musical
