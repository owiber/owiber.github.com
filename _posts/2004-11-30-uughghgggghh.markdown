I think the coming of Nancy's birthday brings illness to my poor weary body (I was sick last year around this time too).  My throat feels a bit weird and I feel I am on the verge of sickness. =(  Sometimes, I smell this weird scent that seems like it is coming from within me... it is not pleasant.  Woe is me!  The wrath of Nancy is upon me! (must have been those pictures...)
