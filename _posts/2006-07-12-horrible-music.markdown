I think I'm making up for my many years in middle school/high school of not really listening to much music because now I'm just having a blast listening to stuff other people would probably classify as horrific (and decades old =).  I'm a bit over my 80's craze (though I still enjoy that decade of music very much) and I've grown a new appreciation for how much stupid fun boy band songs can be.  Is there something wrong with me? =)

For some reason, I really like over-dramatic songs.  Songs where love and/or heart-break (heart-break's usually more fun =) are so exaggerated, it's ridiculous.  I really like songs that are easy to sing along to, ones that are fun and silly.

In that tune, I leave you with some Richard Marx ("Right Here Waiting")... lol:
<blockquote><i>
Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted,all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter,I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh,can't you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh,can't you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you</i></blockquote>For some reason, this song just reminds me of when I was a kid and never worried about anything this song is about, haha...
