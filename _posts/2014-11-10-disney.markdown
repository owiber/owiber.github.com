So I was talking about this with a friend and decided I'd dust off ol' blog to potentially hit a broader audience.

Is there anyone out there that also sees the Disney logo and doesn't immediately recognize the first letter as a D?

<a href="http://www.owiber.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Disney_Logo.png"><img src="http://www.owiber.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Disney_Logo.png" alt="Disney_Logo" width="500" height="266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2591" /></a>

So when I see the Disney logo, I have to very consciously shift my focus to see the letter D. I have a hypothesis that maybe this is because I knew of and recognized the Disney logo before I knew how to read and the whole thing turned into a symbol for me during a time when I primarily identified the logo/word by the bottom left part of the D (the part that kind of loops, which is not a very typical D). Honestly, I don't think it was until late elementary school or middle school that I even realized it was supposed to be a D and not just some made up symbol.

To better visualize what I'm talking about, this is kind of what I initially see:

<a href="http://www.owiber.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Disney_Logo2.png"><img src="http://www.owiber.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Disney_Logo2.png" alt="Disney_Logo2" width="500" height="266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2592" /></a>

Versus:

So... anyone else out there have this too? =)

I also have a story about my nerdy self in middle school to blog about, but I'll save that for another time.
