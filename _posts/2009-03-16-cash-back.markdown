So I've had one of those Citi credit cards that give you cash back ever since 2005.  Apparently, I've never actually claimed the cash back that I've earned throughout these four-ish years.  I logged in to my account recently and noticed that I had accumulated over $600 that was just waiting for me to press a button to claim.

Haha... so I went ahead and did that.  That, combined with the extra $500 from the new <a href="http://www.federalhousingtaxcredit.com/">First-Time Home Buyer Tax Credit</a> is going to go a long way in me actually getting a washer/dryer... now I just need to wade through a ton of reviews to actually find one...
