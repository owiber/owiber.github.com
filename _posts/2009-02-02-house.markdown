No, not that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(TV_series)">House</a>.  Three/four more days until I own a home (or rather, start paying a bank for it)!

It's a bit crazy seeing my living expenses sky-rocket, but at least a chunk of it isn't going completely to waste.

New house checklist (phase 1):
<ul>
<li><del datetime="2009-02-02T07:13:54+00:00">TV</del> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-HL67A750-67-Inch-1080p-Powered/dp/B001413DWQ/">Samsung HL67A750 67" DLP</a>)</li>
<li>Fridge</li>
<li>Living room sofa</li>
<li>Washer/Dryer</li>
<li>Sound system</li>
<li>Blu-ray player (PS3?)</li>
<li>Bean bags</li>
</ul>

Anyone want to live with me for a while? =p
