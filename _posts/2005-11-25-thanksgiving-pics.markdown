<br />Well, I used the "studio" Olivia and I setup to take more pics of our Thanksgiving guests and family.  In many of these pictures, I know what I wanted to do, but I was limited by the lighting and maneauvering room.  I really really wanted to narrow my aperture in many of these pics to get a larger depth of view and to get it sharper, but the lighting just wasn't there and I think I was already maxing the output on my flash.  An addition flash or two for more lighting and balance would really help a lot.  Oh yeah, and if I could walk and take pictures through walls.

Edit: Oh yeah, the set is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/1438671/">here</a>.
