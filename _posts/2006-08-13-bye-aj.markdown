Andrew and Jen leave Austin Sunday morning to get back to Florida.  We went bowling as our last activity with them in Austin and it was pretty fun except that I forgot to eat dinner and was really hungry at the end of it... haha.  Hope you guys have a safe/fun trip back!

Finally got around to washing my car too, which is nice... there are a decent chunk of scratches on the hood of it though (I think from rocks flying up behind trucks)... grrrr... oh well. =p

Oh yes, and I got a haircut (thanks Mom! =) which was also quite needed... I don't like being shaggy. =)
