I know Oliver did this, like... 2 years ago, but technology has improved.  You all should go check out <a href = "http://www.earthviewer.com">EarthViewer</a> as it is a very neat program =)  you have to download it, but... you can get satellite images of a whole lot of places... updated frequently,  what makes it really neat though is, type in an address, and it finds it incredibly quick, and as far as I can tell, goes within 300 or so yards... (the few I tried were that close, i'm guessing less populated areas aren't going to be so accurate, but who knows?)  I was able to recognize a tree in my backyard os yeah, pretty neat =)  only a 14 day trial though, ahwell,  anyway yeah, try =) <br /><br />-Minix
