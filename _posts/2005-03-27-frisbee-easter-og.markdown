Last weekend, Brook, Sam, Mark, and I went to Zilker to play frisbee. <a href="http://oliverweb.com/gallery/Frisbee">Pics</a>.

Today, a bunch of us went to Olive Garden after Worship Without Words at Liquid (which was great, good job to all those who made it happen!).  Kathy deleted one of my pictures! =( CURSES!!  For that, I vow to take a picture of her just as horrible as the ones I take of Viraj on a daily basis.  Your time shall come! &gt;=)  <a href="http://oliverweb.com/gallery/EasterOG">Easter/OG pics</a>.

<a href="http://www.bamboovanpoo.com">Van</a> probably has more to say about the above event.
