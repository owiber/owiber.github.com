So let's see... this weekend we had some more Ultimate Frisbee action... Ryan returned from Cincinnati, Ohio... and... I can't really think of anything else.

Oh, Chad, Viraj and I watched The Mighty Ducks and Rookie of the Year last night instead of The Dark Knight.  That was pretty sweet.  Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack!

I've also decided I am going to end my blog posts, whenever possible, with a webcam shot.  Dine thy eyes on the beauty of my face!

Oh, you thought I'd grace you with my whole face, eh?  Well, you'll just have to visit back for more!
