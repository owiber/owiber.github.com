So Superman Returns was enjoyable, though not as good as I had hoped it would be.  I think Bryan Singer got close, but missed a few elements here and there that kept it from reaching "awesome."  Oh well, I still have hope that the next one will be good.  I think Brainiac as the villain would be cool. =)

Kathy says that my blog is boring, and I think it is too.  I just don't know what to blog about anymore (this has been a problem for a very long time).  I can't really blog much about work because well... I can't mention a lot of the things I do, at least not specifics.  I think it's also that since I see all my friends on a regular basis, there's not a whole lot to blog about that people don't know already.  I had a vision of OliverWEB kinda being my online scrapbook... so I guess I should blog about things even though everyone already knows about it already...

So, tonight Chad finally moved out of The Legacy and after this weekend a decent chunk of us should be living at the new place.  We don't get our internet activated until the 7th, so we'll be leaching wireless off neighbors with varying success in the mean time.

Hrm, well that's all for tonight.  Sorry, nothing exciting. =)
