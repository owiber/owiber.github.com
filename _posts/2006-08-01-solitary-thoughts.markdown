Sometimes when I'm just sitting around, I wonder if in a few years I'll remember that exact moment.   It's kinda like in those movies where you can freeze time and look around and examine things and try to commit that moment in time into memory.  Most of the time, these moments are rather insignificant and just little things like random hang out times or even if I'm just by myself sitting and thinking.  Will I remember my mood?  How I'm feeling?  What people are talking about?  What my relationship with everyone in the room is like?  The lighting, the sounds, the smells?

I guess it brings a sort of peace to me when I just stop and think about how things are going right <i>this instant</i>.  How will this moment in time change my future?  Will I remember what it was like writing this blog post?  The thoughts running through my head that I don't write down?

Probably not, but I like thinking about it.
