Not sure if this <a href=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/51442.html>was me</a>, but that's kinda wierd. I don't remember that.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=markbrandt>Mark lives in Illinois</a>.<br /><br />Dunno what this means, but they want to know <a href=http://www.4x4wire.com/lists/jeepoffroad/200208/msg00000.html>where Chad is</a>.<br /><br />There are way too many Van Nguyens, and Nancy has a <a href=http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Acres/9288/candy.html>Candy Candy</a> website.<br /><br />Nathan has an <a href=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/recognition/2429.html>INSANE amount</a> of stuff on GameFaqs... what a nerd. haha ;) (hey, this one's real too)<br /><br />... oooohhh... I found something interesting...<br /><br />"I'm Segaholic2, known as Nathan Tsui in the real world. I'm 18, a resident of Texas (which is the greatest state ever), and hoping to get into college this fall. I love Sega (obviously), and Sonic Team especially, if that's not a crime by now. I'm also very Asian, which makes me irresistible to teh ladies... Okay, just one. Yuss, I am the luckiest guy on the planet because the coolest girl in the universe likes me. Uhh... Enough gloating."
