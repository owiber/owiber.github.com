Oh how I love JQuery... it's made it so easy to do such nifty things!  I've added a new feature to Owiber.com.  Now whenever I link to a flickr image in my posts, there will be a little up arrow to the right of it.  If you click on it, the page will scroll to the top and load the larger image, and also show a down arrow to go back to where you were (you can actually click almost anywhere in the big image to go back down).  I haven't tested in IE yet (*cross fingers*) but it seems to work fine in Safari and Firefox.  Here's a sample image of Oink for you to play with it... have fun!

<blockquote class="lyrics">"I walked along the avenue.
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you;
Meet a girl like you.
With auburn hair and tawny eyes;
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through;
Hypnotize me through.

And I ran, I ran so far away.
I just ran, I ran all night and day.
I couldn't get away." - A Flock Of Seagulls</blockquote>
