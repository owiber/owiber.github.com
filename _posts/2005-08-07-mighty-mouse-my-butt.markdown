I think I'm pretty tired of seeing Mighty Mouse news/reviews now.  The thing is way overrated.  It's something Apple should have had years ago.  Here's what I think: it is overpriced, and offers no features another mice couldn't do just as good.  With MAYBE the exception of the "360 degrees scrolling," but that was iffy when I used it.  Even then, there are Microsoft/Logitech/whatever mice that can do that too, though, I could see the argument that maybe, just <i>maybe</i> not quite as good, but it'd probably come down to personal preference at that point.  Of course, the only time I could see this coming in handy is in maybe... Photoshop when you're zoomed in.

It can't even do "advanced mouse maneuvers" like holding down the right/left button, and then (while still holding), press (and then maybe hold) the other button.  If you've ever used a 3D editor, this technique is very handy.  And (though this occurs more rarely and probably isn't that big of a deal), you can't click, then pick up the mouse while holding your click.

I swear, Apple's marketing department is so good it drives me crazy when they get people to buy these things...

And people complain about Microsoft copying Apple...





Oh wait, it has aural feedback?!?!?!! WELL HOLY CRAP, BATMAN. I'm going to the Apple Store now.  *sigh*
