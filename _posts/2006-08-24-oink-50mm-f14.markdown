<br />Took this shot with my new 50mm f/1.4.  I think I'm gonna try it out for a bit and maybe sell off my 85L.  I don't think I'll even bring my 85L to Florida... well, maybe I will... hmm, we'll see... I must pack...<br />
I've been making a decent amount of OliverWEB drafts, but haven't come up with a design I want to stick with yet.  Well, I've got a month and so to come up with something, so we'll see. =)<br />
I kind of want to use pink in the new layout, but not too much cause it'll just contrast too much with pictures I post, I think. Haha... maybe a splash... =)

Yes, indeed."</i> - Ursula  (The Little Mermaid)
