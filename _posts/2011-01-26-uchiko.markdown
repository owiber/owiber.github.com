I took my mom to Uchiko and got their 10 course meal thingy.  It was quite tasty!

I also decided to get a new receiver because my Onkyo was kind of crapping out and having issues with certain inputs.  Decided to get a Pioneer VSX-1020-K, which I just got today and installed.  I'm now letting Star Trek play to "break it in" (I don't think I need to do that).  While installing the receiver, I discovered that some punk had unplugged my subwoofer and who knows how long that's been that way.  Hmph.

In other food related news, I booked a reservation at <a href="http://www.theworlds50best.com/awards/1-50-winners/alinea">Alinea</a>!

Oh, also, here are a lot of Olivers from the past year or so of blog posts (click for larger version).
