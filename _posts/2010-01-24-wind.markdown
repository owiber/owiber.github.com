Well, ultimate on Saturday was spoiled a bit by crazy wind, but we had a <em>lot</em> of people show up, which was pretty cool.  Can't wait until we have those numbers with a calmer day.  That'll be awesome.

After frisbee, food, and a nap, I went to Al's birthday bash with Ryan.  It was a themed party, if you can't tell from the photos...

I used to cry till I was dry.
Still sometimes I get a strange pain inside

Oh, Joey, if you're hurting so am I." - Concrete Blonde</blockquote>
