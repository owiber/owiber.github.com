So an intern here at work showed me this <a href="http://snakesonaplane.varitalk.com/">Snakes on a Plane</a> site where you can customize a message from Samuel L. Jackson to send to people via phone or email.  It's pretty entertaining.  I tried sending some messages to a few people, but I'm not sure if they got through.  Oh well. =)

Have fun and a <i>stupppeennddous</i> day!  Lol...
