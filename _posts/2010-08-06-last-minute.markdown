Woaah, I just realized I haven't made a post for last week yet and this next weekend is fast approaching!

About the only thing I can remember is I played ultimate.  Oh... and I helped Melissa move into her new apartment.  I guess that's about it.  I should really write these things closer to when they happen. =P

This past week, we made many more failed attempts at Sindragosa (we're giving up for now and resetting for next week to try again at a later point).  I've also been meaning to make some more <a href="http://samitic.us">Samiticus</a> posts, as I have material, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.  Maybe tomorrow.  Earlier today (well, Thursday), BV just had our latest all-hands at the Austin Music Hall and I have some entertaining pics I'll get up shortly (probably by the end of tomorrow).

With that said, on to photo editing!  Tata!
