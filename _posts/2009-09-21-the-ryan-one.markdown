This weekend, we moved Ryan into my house in about two hours thanks to Al, Eduardo, Tiff, and Kalyn (in addition to Ryan and myself, of course).  It was a pretty quick move and Ryan promptly setup his bed and slept.  This weekend also marked the debut of the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jryanfunsponge">JRyanFunSponge Twitter account</a> where Al, Eduardo and I will be chronicling the adventures of Ryan at Oliver's house in first person Ryan perspective.

Also on Saturday (it was a busy day), I watched the UT/Tech game and then headed over to Tiff's bday/house-warming bash, which I'm sure there will be pictures posted from (I forgot to bring my camera).

Sunday, I got a hair cut (thanks, Mom!), played some frisbee with Andrew, Mark, and OMan, then took humor in watching the Cowboys lose their first game in their brand new stadium.  Hah!
