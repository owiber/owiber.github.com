Yes, I've added even MORE stuff to OliverWEB. =) I've added a few more quotes to the random generator's list of quotes (which can be seen <a href="random.txt">here</a>) and added another pics section, making page <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/8/index.shtml">eight</a>! I've linked to the <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/boredom2/quotes/index.shtml">Quotes</a> page from the sidebar (the '-' means that the link is a subsection of the section above it) and added the <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/olivetti.shtml">Olivetti</a> page (which I thought was quite funny =) to my <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/index.shtml">StUfF</a>.<br /><br />-Oliver
