McNeil is hosting its first ever annual fair, and guess what?!<br /><br />Several people on this site are involved...<br /><br />Olivia, Christine and Cathy are part of the Chinese Booth.<br />Oliver is part of the Orient booth.<br />Van is part of some booth... not sure which... sorry Van...<br />Brook, Chad, and... ME!  are all part of the White American Culture booth =)<br /><br />The fair is tomorrow (4-12) and I suggest everyone that reads this come... show up anytime from 6-8:30, come see friends!  Fun stuff!  <br /><br />And now it's time for me to explain the White American Culture booth... until today, this group was not part of the fair, but we see this as discrimation, and so now are making the booth, we got permission.  White American Culture steals from all other cultures... we are proud of this, and plan to show it off =)<br /><br />Go crackers!<br /><br />lol... we aren't really that proud, but we hope it will be funny.  And... to some extent... we're hoping we wont be suspended once they understand our full purpose... come watch!<br /><br />-Minix
