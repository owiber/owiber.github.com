I just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/pancy">Nancy's Xanga</a> while in CS341, and I feel sorry for her and her pharmacy woes. So I made something in Linux GIMP with my touchpad for her.<br /><br />The following is a flower in a medicine bottle for Nancy. And while I was at it, I threw in a Daredevil for Chad, a new hat for Mark, a ginseng root (haha! =) for Andrew, the C&C:Generals honorable medal for Brook (I don't remember what it looked like, so my picture is just a yellow thing), and some smelly green fuming poop for Van. I didn't know what to give Megan, so she gets a lolipop.  Viraj gets a 10x10 pixel area of white space on the bottom right corner of the image.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/gift.png" width="256" height="256" border="1"></center><br /><br />=)<br /><br />-Oliver
