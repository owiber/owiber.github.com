I don't know why I put an exclamation point in this post's title, because I don't really have a spring break (oh woe are those in the working world, haha ;).  Regardless, I had a blast in Surfside, TX at a beach house.  Many thanks to Kathy for putting up with us and fronting the planning, it really is a rather difficult thing to do.

I'm in the process of uploading a lot of pictures to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber">flickr</a>, but it's taking forever... once they're there, I may title/comment on some of them and create a set.  The other photographers on the trip have other pictures, especially a higher ratio of pictures including myself in them (and... that's something I may or may not be interested in you seeing, haha).

Kathy, Ochs, Van and I went to Sam's grandfather's funeral today.  I'm finding it difficult to put words on the experience, but it was quite obvious he was loved by many people.  Please continue praying for Sam and his family, especially his grandmother.
