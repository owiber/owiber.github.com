Nothing much, just a few small updates. =)

So my team at Bazaarvoice hit our stretch goals and were rewarded with a scrumptious meal at Truluck's.  That was pretty cool.

We were also named one of the <a href="http://www.herringevents.com/global07/redherring100_winners.html">Global Top 100 Tech Startups</a> by Red Herring.  I'm not entirely sure what criteria they used (looks like not raw worth in cash, since Facebook didn't make it), but we're on the list along with Mozilla, Wikia, and others I don't know much about. =)  Another award we recently got was a <a href="http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2007/09/10/story4.html">Top Tech Innovation</a> award from the Austin Business Journal.  It's pretty cool working at such an awesome company... we just <a href="http://bazaarvoice.com/jobs.html">need more people!</a>

And... a pretty belated virtual happy birthday to my sister who I just recently purchased a belated gift for. =p
