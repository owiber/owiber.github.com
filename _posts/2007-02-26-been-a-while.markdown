Hm, it's been a while since I've made a blog post.  I took some weddings pics a little while ago and just finished processing some of them in Lightroom, which I still need to fully get the hang of.  The internet/wireless at my house is a bit choppy though, so I haven't been able to upload them, otherwise I'd post a few.

Let's see... there was a midnight pillow fight thing at UT a while back I went to take pics of, but it turned out to not be as awesome as I had hoped. I didn't really get any good shots, so I'm not even going to bother posting any.

I got sick on TH/F and developed a fever on Saturday.  It was not cool.  I've been at home just kinda bumming, sleeping, and eating, but I think I'm recovering now.  This means I'm missing Vox Veniae's first <a href="http://veniae.vox.com/library/post/portals.html">Portals</a> (gotta love the fancy names =), which I was looking forward to, but what can ya do. =(

Hmmmm... oh yeah, I have decided to go on a missions trip to New Orleans during spring break.  I hadn't really thought about it until recently, but I have never actually gone on a missions trip before.  There were a few times where I almost went, but something always came up that stopped me from going.  I'm hoping this will be a good experience for everyone involved. =)  When I was going to ask off that week from work, I thought the chances of me actually getting it were pretty slim, but it turned out to work itself out rather nicely, so I'm taking that as divine "thumbs up" sign. ;)
