Anyone have any experience with any wifi webcams?  Thinking of setting one up in my game room. Or maybe I'll get a regular webcam, but then I'd have to leave my (probably) Mac Mini on the whole time just for it so that seems like overkill.

We went to the new BV office to preview it on Monday.  It seems quite a bit larger!  I forgot to bring my camera though and the ones I took on my iPhone are at such a disappointing resolution, I don't even want to bother with them.
