This is what came out of my short toying with iMovie.

Viraj and I had a lot of fun with this one. Except for the names, all the text is default.

Last night, I summoned Sam over so Viraj and I could show him the above video.  Then, we told him to go home.  Haha... actually, we made him drive us to Walgreens where we purchased milk, chips, beef jerky, ramen, sardines, and tuna.  I think Viraj may have gotten some other stuff but I can't remember.  Viraj made the dark hot chocolate I got from Seattle, which was pretty rich.  I think as far as hot chocolate goes, milk chocolate is the way to go... it was like drinking a melted dark chocolate bar... haha.  Then, we watched part of a high school football game at 3AM.  That was awesome.
