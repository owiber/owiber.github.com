I'm itching to work on a little software project I can place on <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</a> but I can't think of anything to do. =/

I took back some big prints of pics we had at Liquid and currently Sam getting <a href="http://oliverweb.com/gallery/NYC2004/IMG_6551">owned by a snowball</a> is hanging on the wall above my computer. Wheeee.
