Poo.  I think I have the flu.  I was in kind of a hazardous mood tonight and considered attempting to run a few miles and see if I would die, but I decided I would probably regret doing that, so I didn't. =p

I don't think I've ever sweat this much due to sickness before.  I went to the bathroom and had my head tilted down and sweat drops actually fell from my forehead.

Ugh, my head hurts.  I guess I won't say anything else...
