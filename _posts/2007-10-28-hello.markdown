Poor neglected blog.  I have been too busy to do anything with it.  I also, highly doubt, that I will be able to do my yearly redesign of OWeb this year, seeing that there are only four days left in October and I have other, more pressing matters, to devote my time to. =)

I'll try to post pics of my Halloween costume this year, though... and if I don't here, I'm sure it will be on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber">flickr</a>, which is less neglected. =)

Sleep well, blog... perhaps I will have more time in the future...
