Boy I love my EE class. It's so exciting! Actually... no.<br /><br />At the moment, I'm in the back of the class typing away on my Powerbook while listening to my iPod.  I have no clue what the professor is saying and I've totally tuned him out.  My phone started ringing though, and that's bad cause today I forgot to silence it.<br /><br />This guy is really boring, I think I do better just looking at the book. Lunch with sister today. Oh boy oh boy! lol, j/k j/k... ;)<br /><br />-Oliver
