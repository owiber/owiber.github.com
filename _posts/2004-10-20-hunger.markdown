Man, I'm hungry.  Lunch is 1.5 hours away though, *sigh*. Got my EE test back... 4th highest in the class, so I think I'm good. =)  I could have been the 2nd highest, but I accidently misread part of a question and only answered it half-way (even though the other half was SUPER EASY).  Oh well. Wheeeeee!  I think I'm looking good for an A in this class, here's shooting for a straight 4.0 this semester! *cough cough*

So far, we've spent 2+ weeks on logic circuits, it is the most hotness ever because I don't have to listen to my professor at all!  Queen is the hotness too.  Speaking of hotness, the weather is not so terribly hot or cold, but it's a bit cloudy.  Makes me not bring my camera to school because I don't want to get rained on. POO!  I want to test my new lense...
