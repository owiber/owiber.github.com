Yesterday, I tried to get that Amazon XBox 360 Core for $100 deal, but that failed miserably.  Haha, it was pretty funny to see us on planeteers as it was going on with all of us trying to refresh the page.

Went to the Round Rock Outlet Mall at midnight and got some clothes today.  Had some hot chocolate and some nice sleep time and now I'm just bumming the rest of Black Friday away.

Here are some pics from Olivia's birthday dinner with the family:

My sister loves the pictures I take:
