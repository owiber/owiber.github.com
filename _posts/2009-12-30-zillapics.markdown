Over the Christmas break, we raided some old photos.  My sister snatched a few to digitize in order to make sure some of the crimes done against us were documented.

This one of me, in particular, is a beauty:

There are many more over at <a href="http://www.livizilla.com/2009/12/28/seester/">livizilla.com</a>.  Sometimes, I am honestly surprised I didn't get physically beaten up.  Little did I know that I lived in constant danger... ahhh... ignorance.

On another note, the iMac 27" is too much for Photo Booth to handle.  When it turns the screen white as a pseudo-flash, it basically washes out the resulting picture.  Luckily, I discovered that holding down shift while taking the photo makes it not do that... but that was after I took this beauty (which somehow isn't as washed out as other ones I've taken):

Hmm, I need a haircut...
