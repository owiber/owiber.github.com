So when we were cleaning my old room out, we found a project Oriana had worked on about sharks.  It was supposed to be an informative book I suppose, so I will leave you with a page from it:

Haha, we all started laughing when we saw that.  The sunglasses were a nice touch. =)

<blockquote class="lyrics">"The evidence convicts the hollow man
After looking inside
To my dismay I find I'm just one of them
Cause I'm an already but not yet resurrected fallen man
Come break this limbo
And I know you know just who I've been
Come define me

Rumor has it you love me
Rumor has it the world spins upside down
Rumor has it my only hope is you
And the rumors are true
I turn everything over" - Switchfoot</blockquote>
