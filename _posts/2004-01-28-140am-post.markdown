Like the title suggests, I'm making (well, starting at least) this post at 1:40AM. Weee. I just watched a bunch of trailers on Apple's site and now I'm in a mode of "deep contemplation." The only thing is that I'm not sure what I'm contemplating about. =)  <br /><br />Hmm... anyways, saw the Jersey Girl trailer again and thought that that looks like another movie you'd go to on a date.  Well, that lead me to Kevin Smith's <a href="http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/jerseygirl/">online diary</a> on it and it seems like he thinks it's the best movie he's every made (although very different from his other movies). *shrug* Also found some movie that Stupid Blond Girl From 24 is in and... uhh... as VJ would put it, it looked pretty squirty. I love how that can mean both something really good and something really bad... and I'm not even going to clarify, so it'll be left as vague as ever.<br /><br />School's not too bad yet, although I see the horrible onslaught of Chinese + multiple CS projects + tests + extracurricular activities + work eventually hammering at my head and state of "sanity."  So far, I've just got Chinese and Liquid website stuff... and that's not too bad.<br /><br />It's always quiet in the room with just Sam and I.  We both have headphones on and are on our computers.  Samitucus or Samiticus, which spelling do you guys like better?<br /><br />Uhhh... bathroom time.<br /><br />-Oliver
