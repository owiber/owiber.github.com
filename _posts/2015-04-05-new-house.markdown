Mark and I have purchased a sweet house and we moved in last weekend. We've still got a number of things on order that have yet to arrive, but it's pretty great. It has two master bedrooms, so it was convenient to co-purchase. Here's a video of when I took Mozilla to the house shortly after closing:
