Hello my poor blog!

I've been trying to find a picture of my WoW gnome, Powderpuff, but have been unsuccessful.  Does anyone have a screenshot of my pink haired gnome? =) Almost makes me tempted to reactivate so I can take a screenshot...

I recently purchases a macro lens that is quite fun to use, although I haven't shot with it all that much yet.  I posted a few shots with it previously, but here are a few more:

I also purchased <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy's_Ghost_Recon_Advanced_Warfighter_2">GRAW2</a> for Andrew (as well as a copy for myself) and we've been playing through the co-op missions which has been pretty entertaining.  I agree with Mark that it would probably be more fun with a keyboard and mouse, but there's just no beating the convenience of multiple people playing on one 360 (and over Xbox Live) and not having to arrange a LAN party (... which we should do sometime =).

Oh... by the way, anyone want to buy a black MacBook (2GHz, 2GB RAM, 120GB HD)?
