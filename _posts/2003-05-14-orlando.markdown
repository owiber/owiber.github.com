We're in Orlando right now (specifically, a Starbucks using the T-Mobile HotSpot wireless stuff).<br /><br />We got 10PM Matrix Reloaded tickets too =D. And the theater doesn't look like it's going to be too crowded either. (none of the shows were sold out)<br /><br />Anyhow, we'll have pics and stories to tell eventually... including an encounter with a cop. ;)<br /><br />-Oliver
