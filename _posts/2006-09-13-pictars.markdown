I went through my photos in Aperture again (well, mostly just the shoots that had over/nearly 200 photos) to filter out the bad pictures to free up some disk space.  I think I deleted a gig or two worth of pictures I would never use.  Man, RAWs (especially from the 5D) can be pretty massive, haha.

Posted two pictures from the Florida trip that I didn't process/upload the first round through:

I had this strange dream that made me wake up 15 or so minutes later than I intended on.  Apparently, I was supposed to walk down this model runway thing and show off... something... it wasn't clothes, but something I was holding, I don't remember what but it seemed like piece of paper.  Anyways, I was dreaming I had to use the shower, but I was in this strange house that had a bajillion doors and lots of people all over the place and I was trying to find a place I could shower in private.  I found this one shower in the kitchen, but seeing as it was the kitchen, it was pretty exposed.  There was one in the laundry room, but full of tons of random stuff, so I went outside to this one cabin looking thing but got stuck trying to figure out how to lock all the doors... it was kinda weird... I woke up around then.

I was really looking forward to running with a new nano and using the Nike+ thing today, but now I gotta wait for the engraving and for it to ship.  Oh well, at least my iPod is <i>Andrew Approved</i>, and I can try out my new shoes.

I would sell you out
I'd give you all away

But I gotta get another taste
