Today, I used 8000 American Express Membership Reward points and bought the following CD's for free:<ul><li>Transformers Soundtrack</li><li>Newsboys - Shine</li><li>All Star United</li></ul>Yay! I'm glad I was able to use those points for something of worth. =)<br /><br />I always thought that Queen did the music for Transformers... but it doesn't look like they did...<br /><br />-Oliver
