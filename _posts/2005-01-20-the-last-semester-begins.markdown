Yup, I still live.  I should probably be asleep right now, but I had a two hour nap earlier, so I think I'll be ok.  School has begun and I'm getting back into the groove of things I think (including a "normal" sleeping schedule).

In WoW, I've surpassed level 40 and have attained a mount. R0x0r. "Tomorrow" (actually later today), I have a digital lounge meeting.  Hmmm... I suppose that's all for now.  Everyone have a great Spring '05. =)
