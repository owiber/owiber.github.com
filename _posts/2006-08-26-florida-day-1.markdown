So Day 1 in Florida (not counting the day we arrived) was spent at Busch Gardens.  In the following video, you can see Andrew, Van and I slightly confused as far as amusement parks go... (Floridians will probably not understand this):



We also rode ultra-exciting rides like the following log ride (feel free to stop watching after a minute or so... it gets boring after that, haha):



Haha... actually, it was pretty fun (and the coasters were more lively than the above =)... Kathy even went on some! ...and got really nasty wrinkled feet from getting socks/shoes soaked... ewww... but she wouldn't let me take a picture of them.

Afterwards, we went back to Jen's place and watched Four Brothers... better than I expected it to be, actually, haha.
