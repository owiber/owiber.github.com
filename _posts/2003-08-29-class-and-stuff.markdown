Well, I've got a decent amount of web-stuff to do... which is taking a decent amount of my time, but oh well. =)<br /><br />My classes seem pretty cool... Computer Networks - we're doing some neat stuff with actual real examples (ie. something called the Internet). Computer Graphics - OpenGL time!  Computer Architecture - the prof. worked at IBM and now at Intel... he helped with the G5 core and the maybe-soon-to-be Pentium 5.  Pretty neat.  Comp Arch looks like it'll be pretty fun too, it's the class I'm looking forward to the most.<br /><br />-Oliver
