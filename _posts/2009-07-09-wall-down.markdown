I had contractors over at my place today to take down a wall and replace some wood flooring with tile.  Here're some mid-progress photos:

Tomorrow, the tiling starts!  Yaaaay!

Please don’t take my heart away
Promise me, just one more night
Then we’ll go our separate ways
We’ve always had time on our sides
Now it’s fading fast
Every second, every moment
We’ve got to, We’ve got to make it last

I touched you once, I touched you twice
I won’t let go at any price
I need you now like I needed you then
You always said we'd still be friends someday" - OMD</blockquote>
