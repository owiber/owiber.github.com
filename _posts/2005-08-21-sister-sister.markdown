"How about that two way twister..."

So the family (including myself) went to help Olivia move into her apartment.  I will point out that a certain bum kid boyfriend did not show up!* &gt;=| lol... Anyways, I'll post pics sometime later when I have access to my own computer.  She's got a pretty nice place over in the Far West area.

If the images below are broken... it might be because your ISP's DNS hasn't updated OliverWEB yet (and you're accessing OliverWEB directly through its IP...)... essentially, it should be working in a day or so.

While I was listening to the Lion King soundtrack, I realized that a lot of songs meant for kids (at least the good old Disney ones) are actually pretty intelligent and very clever.  Much more so than a lot of the crap played on the radio meant for "adults" (especially that pop stuff ;).  I wonder how much kids actually pick up, but it's pretty neat anyhow.

<i>So prepare for the coup of the century
Be prepared for the murkiest scam
Meticulous planning
Tenacity spanning
Decades of denial
Is simply why I'll
Be king undisputed
Respected, saluted
And seen for the wonder I am
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!</i>

*Edit: k, he had a decent excuse, I'm just teasing. =)
