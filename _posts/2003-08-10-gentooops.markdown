uhhh... so I was compiling KDE and OpenOffice.org-Ximian at the same time and I managed to use over 2GB up in the compilation of the two of those, which resulted in me using up 100% of that partition. Oops.  Time for # parted /dev/hda.<br /><br />In contrast, my 7GB partition for /home is using less than 4% of that allocated space.  I think I know where to put some of that extra space....<br /><br />-Oliver
