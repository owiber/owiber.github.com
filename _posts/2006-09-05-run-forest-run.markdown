Oh goody goody goody, cooler weather. =)

Also, I just wanted to let everyone know that nothing's official until it is on <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> and everything on there is 100% factual and must be taken seriously.  Either that, or must be scrutinized to the nth degree to find the hidden meanings.  It's <i>crazy</i>, I tell you, <i>crazy</i>!!!

That being said, I would like to say that Sam is a big fat copy-cat.
