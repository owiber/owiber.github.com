It's done!  Viraj provided assistance in interviewing and some creative juices, if you know what I mean. Erhm...

When we played this to Sam, he sent me a multitude of cuss words.  <3 Sam. ;)

Viraj made me censor a scene, but if you know me and want to see it, friend me on YouTube (owiber) and I may give you access to the uncensored version. =)

I wish I had gotten more footage, but not feeling well for part of the trip took a toll on my willingness to film much.  Wish I had more footage of others on the trip.  Next time!  Enjoy!
