Day six was a bit of a day off... we decided to do something a bit exotic and got some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetbread">sweetbread</a> which we grilled.

Then, we chilled a bit until Ryan and I went to III Forks for our Bazaarvoice Technical Services team goal celebration.  I continued the meat eating and got a filet mignon which was acceptably good although I wouldn't say amazing.

After II Forks, we went to Chancy's to celebrate the Nancy/Ochs bdays and hung out for a while.  Now, it's suckling pig smoking time for our finale! Stay tuned...
