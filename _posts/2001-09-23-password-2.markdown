I was also going to get rid of the login/password thing on OliverWEB tonight by making it automatically log you in... which is a semi-crude way of doing it, since I would still be checking to see if you logged in on every single page... kinda stupid.<br /><br />As a result, I decided to do it the real way and actually remove all the password/login checking codes from the pages (the <i>"elegant"</i> way)... so um... the login/password thing will be there a while longer. Lo siento. =)<br /><br />I watched Van, AJ, and I's Spanish project again today... great stuff, I'm going to have to try to put it on OliverWEB and put up subtitles... quality is really really poor though... we weren't exactly the best filmers. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
