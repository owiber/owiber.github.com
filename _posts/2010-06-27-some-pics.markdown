And here're some pics of my room... but Sam ruined one of them.

Today, I played ultimate which was awesome, but my toes hurt and it was hot.  It was still awesome though.  My face was really red for a while afterwards... I should probably put sunscreen on it next time.  After that, we watched the USA/Ghana game and grilled steak (I should say Mark grilled the steak and we ate it).  Then, there was a lot of UT2004'ing (I took a nap during a few rounds of that though).

Now, I'm just chilling to some Jars of Clay.   Oh, I also did more work on <a href="http://samitic.us">Samitic.us</a>, including an under-construction <a href="http://samitic.us/samboard-the-sam-ni-soundboard/">Sam Ni soundboard ("Samboard")</a> (warning: profanity).

Tata!
