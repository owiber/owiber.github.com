I saw <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2006/09/flickr-support-for-blogger-in-beta.html">this</a> and was pretty impressed that the Yahoo! folks (Flickr's parent company) started to support Blogger (a Google company).  I always thought it would be really nifty if Picasa (Google) had some kind of integration with Flickr -- it seemed like a great match (even though I don't really use Picasa anymore), but thought it was pretty much impossible because of the rivalry the parent companies have.  Well, seeing as how Flickr has extended signs of friendship to the Google camp, maybe they'll return the favor and integrate with Flickr a bit in Picasa?  That would be pretty sweet... I liked Picasa a lot more than iPhoto.

Oh yes, and I'm decking myself out in the Apple/Nike gear if new nanos come out today (I'm thinking yes). Barton, here I come... =)
