Well, I'm in lab hours for another almost two hours so I'm really really bored. I guess I might start on a CS project soon because there are absolutely no CS307 students in the lab right now (there isn't even a CS307 assignment due this week).<br /><br />Anyways, was looking at the Upcoming Movies on <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">RT</a> and it looks pretty exciting:<ul><li>Spider-Man 2<br /><li>Kill Bill: Volume 2<br /><li>The Passion of the Christ<br /><li>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban<br /><li>Jersey Girl</ul><br />Weeeee!<br /><br />Wo de benzi qu shangdian porque Dezhou he cha.
