As is probably apparent by my previous posts, I opted to stay in town to welcome in 2010 instead of venturing to Dallas with Heather, Steph and Ryan.  That being the case, I saw in the new year with a few peeps over at my place who just hung out and played games mostly.  I also volunteered to dog-sit Ally as Chancy went to another party.

On Saturday, since nearly everyone is out of town for a while, Mark and I worked on our frisbee technique.  I'm happy to say that I am quite content with where my back-hand throw is now (it previously was utterly terrible) which has gotten stronger and more accurate.  After nearly two hours of that, we went to get food then Brook showed up with a few peeps and we played a relatively short 3v3 game.  <3 Ultimate.

I also watched the Tech and Cowboys games, Sherlock Holmes, and the ending of a horrible "SyFy" movie - Flu Bird Horror.  I'd say two of those four were satisfying, one was mediocre, and one, I am lucky to have seen without suffering brain damage.  I will let you guess which is what.
