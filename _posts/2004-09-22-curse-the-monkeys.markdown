Well POOO!!! I made one stupid mistake on my EE test and so I didn't get the 100 I thought I might've. Darn. =)  Well, I still got a 92 though, which was the 3rd highest in the class, so I'm still looking good.  Just a bit annoying. =)<br /><br />Sam recently found a bruise on his right arm in virtually the exact same shape, location, and color as mine.  It's really really weird as the spot it's at isn't really the easiest of spots to get a bruise.  Something's fishy.... lol<br /><br />-Oliver
