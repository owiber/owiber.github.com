I want to post some lyrics, so I gotta come up with a blog post to go along with it...

I just had dinner at Plucker's with Al:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/3492950782/" title="BV-TS-PlayDay-048 by owiber, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3557/3492950782_1a91743f12.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="BV-TS-PlayDay-048" /></a>

Good times as usual.  Thanks, Al!

In other news, I need to replace my roof after the hail storm a while or whatever ago.  Thankfully, that's what insurance is for!  It actually works out pretty well, since I'd probably need to replace it in a few years anyways.  Should I look into getting a metal roof? :mrgreen:  I likely would have figured this out a while ago had a solicitor not assumed I was an <a href="http://twitter.com/owiber/status/1560909656">adolescent child</a>, which made me not listen to her at all.  Anyways, inspector said it was pretty scratched up but I didn't have any immediate risk of leaks or anything, so I'll get around to getting that done soon.

I'm prepping to get some other contract work done on my house, like removing a wall or two and tiling some floor.  I'll post pics when that happens (maybe even this coming week)!

<blockquote class="lyrics">"I'm lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you hurt too but what else can we do
Tormented and torn apart
I wish I could carry your smile and my heart
For times when my life feels so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know" -Air Supply</blockquote>
