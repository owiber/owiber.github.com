Brook, Megan, Mark and I just watched eight episodes of 24 (Mark got season 1 on DVD, six DVDs at that)... and... wow, that is one awesome show.  I'm tempted to watch it instead of Smallville (blasphemous? ;), but I probably won't just because I'm not sure if I can go a WHOLE WEEK on some of those cliff hangers... wow. It'd probably be better for my mental state to wait until all of season 2 is out on DVD then watch it in one HUGE splurge again...<br /><br />wow... 12 more hours of 24 to go...<br /><br />-Oliver
