<h1>Dedicated</h1><br />I thrive upon being vague,<br />I suppose it's something to do.<br />It releases me from the infinite plague<br />That never ceases to be you.<br /><br />And yeah you're causing me problems again,<br />So i pretend you're probably not there.<br />Released from responsibility for my actions<br />By forcing myself to never care.<br /><br />What am I thinking?<br />Or am i thinking at all?<br />My boat can't possibly be sinking.<br />The water is just minutely tall.<br /><br />There was a man who burned his hand,<br />And blamed it on the stove.<br />He subsequently buried it in the sand<br />And far away he drove.<br />In a new house he now resides.<br />His previous wife has long since died.<br />And longing for years that will never come<br />From his new life,<br />He only fails to hide.<br /><br />-Anonymous<br /><br /><br />-Chad
