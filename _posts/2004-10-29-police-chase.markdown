Tonight, at about 4AM, a police helicopter started circling our apartment with spotlights blazing.  Here's a shot of the cop parked outside our rooms, <a href="http://www.bamboovanpoo.com">Van</a> probably has some more shots, and <a href="http://www.xanga.com/your_shadow">Sam</a> has a little blog about the event as well.  Heh... we're in an awesome area. =)

On another note, I just downloaded <a href="http://www.picasa.com">Picasa</a>, the picture album program <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> bought and made free (yay!).  I like it lots better than iPhoto and it makes me happy. =D
