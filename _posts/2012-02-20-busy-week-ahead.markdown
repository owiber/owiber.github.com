I'm heading to Hawaii for some fun/relaxation next Sunday so this week is probably going to be a busy one at work. I also, somewhat coincidentally, have a rather pleasant schedule of foodie events at the end of the week with stops planned at at least Foreign & Domestic and Uchiko. Yay!

I've had to keep an eye out on Mozilla this weekend as he got neutered on Thursday and I'm trying to not have to resort to the cone of shame. He's been fairly good so far but seems to be rather reluctant to pee (does so much less frequently than before). I'll probably give the vet a ring tomorrow to see if I should bring him in for a check-up.

Viraj is back from India, apparently, but did not return with a wife. We are all disappointed. On the plus side, he did his chip eating thing where he would only eat the part of the chip he didn't touch. He had built up a small pile of chip pieces that were "tainted" with his fingers. I saw them, shook my head, and made him eat them. There's that to be proud of, I guess. ;p
