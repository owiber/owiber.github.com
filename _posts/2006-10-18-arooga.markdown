So I picked up a pull up bar the other day to put in Van and I's room and it seems to be holding up alright.  I think I felt bad for not running and I wanted to do some type of exercise, haha.  Anyways, we installed it yesterday and I did some pull ups and now my abs are sore, haha...

Do you guys have a regular prayer schedule?  For example, a lot of people pray before they eat, in the shower, etc. etc.  Do you pray during those times, and/or have time you set aside to pray?  What do you find is your best prayer time and what makes it the best?  Do you think having a regular schedule is good/bad?  Oh, I guess maybe I should save these questions for my Elements... but you all can answer them too. =)

I've heard that prayer should be a continuous lifestyle type thing, like you are always in conversation with God.  Do you find you are able to do this?  If you are, do you find or think it beneficial to also have a "quiet time" where you put aside time with the main intent of prayer?
