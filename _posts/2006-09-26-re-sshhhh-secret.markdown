I haven't blogged about this much, mainly because my blog is a bit too public and I don't want this leaking to too many people.  However, I discovered the password-protect post feature of WordPress, so I figured this is a good time to test it. =)

Over the past few weeks, I've grown... mmmm... tired (?) of my job.  There are a ton of interesting things and I like the group, but I don't think it's pushing me in a direction I want to go.  Web design/development has always been a hobby of mine and I now think I want to push towards that as my career.  I think it would be really cool to work on something like <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> and I think someday I'll have the skill and experience to back me up to pursue such a position.  For the time being though, I want to stay in Austin around my family and friends.  I think the roots of that is I'm afraid of being lonely if I moved away, but I really do like Austin too and there seem to be no shortage of techy jobs here, so it's not too much trouble to stay.  Maybe someday I'll move elsewhere, but I have an urge to stay right now, so that's what I'll be doing.

Anyways, I had an interview today with a company called <a href="http://www.loopone.com">Loop One</a> which is owned by <a href="http://www.neopost.com">neopost</a>, a rather large French company that does shipping/mailing stuff, apparently.  Loop One, is the more high-techy/web part of neopost and they develop a web application that handles shipping... they gave me a demo and it's all AJAX-ified and everything, which is neat.  I think it went pretty well and it seems like a pretty exciting place to work.  It's not as flashy or exciting as Flickr, but I think it'd be a good launching pad for me... if they give me an offer, I'm thinking I will probably accept.  Now, usually, I laugh at the French because they're funny, but there is one major benefit of working for a French company.  France has a freakin' crazy amount of holidays and thus, are pretty lenient on Loop One when it comes to that.  They had Columbus Day off for crying out loud!  The PTO there seems to be pretty comparable to Freescale too, so I'm happy with that. =)  We'll see how this goes...

I feel a bit sorry for my interim boss at Freescale (my previous one left to another company).  I told him last week I was looking around for other jobs and he's trying to give me reason to stay by giving me projects that are "web related" because I told him that's where my interest lies.  Unfortunately, "web related" in an embedded systems environment is still pretty low level and merely means you push some data over a network (either wired or wireless)... so the projects he suggests, although interesting, are not really "web applications" which I'm mainly interested in.  The group is already pretty swamped as it is, and it is going to be tricky to find a replacement for me (maybe even just to get a req open to try to hire someone), so my leaving is probably not going to help things, but I don't think I can let that stop me from going.

Uhhh... that's all I want to say for now.  Tata.

Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead
It seems to last forever, and time goes slowly by
Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly

'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight
The moment that he's with me, everything's alright
Night time is the right time, we make love
Then it's his and my time, we take off

My baby takes the morning train, he works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again to find me waitin' for him" - Sheena Easton</blockquote>
