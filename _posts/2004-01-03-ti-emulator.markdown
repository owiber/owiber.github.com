Well, I just IM'ed Chad with this... but I'll go ahead and make a post about it too cause I seem to remember a few people being interested in it (Van? Andrew? I forget exactly who).  Anyways, I found a nifty TI emulator with images of the TI calculators too... I had to grab the ROMs off of another site (I'm guessing it's not all that legal to host the ROM images?)... but I got them and threw them into the emulator's ZIP file which I've uploaded <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/vti.zip">here</a>. Please don't report me to TI.<br /><br />Ahem... to TI: I own a TI83 and have uploaded the ROM image to my website for backup purposes only. Please ignore the TI86.ROM file. Thanks. ;)<br /><br />-Oliver
