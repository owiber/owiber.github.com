So that game was pretty terrible.  I'm kind of glad I'll be in London for the OU game cause I don't think I want to watch anymore UT football until they stop beating themselves.

Besides that, the weather was pretty good for a fun ultimate game, we played a decent amount of DotA, I got a haircut, went to Parkside for Tiff's birthday, skyped with Melissa after she returned from Thailand and... what else... maybe that's it.  I slept a lot probably. =p

I ordered a Kindle to prepare for my upcoming international flights (London at the end of this week and Hong Kong for New Year's).  I'm thinking I'll finally read Ender's Game and maybe start on the Harry Potter books.  We'll see.

Update: Oh!  I almost forgot... I also watched <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/165345/syfy-original-movies-sharktopus">Sharktopus</a>, which was horrible and awesome.
