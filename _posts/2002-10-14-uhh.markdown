So yeah, Alex tells me that My Sassy Girl has english subtitles, so I go download it off Kazaa... I start to watch it and discover that it's in Korean with Chinese (I think?) subtitles... so it isn't helping me much.<br /><br />As far as I can tell from watching 20 minutes of it is that this girl is being pretty mean to this guy and he's having a lot of things go wrong for him because he helped her out... or something like that.<br /><br />I've given up so far though until I can find an english version. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
