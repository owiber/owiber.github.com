Tomorrow, I have my final walk-through of my soon-to-be-house before closing.  I'll bring my camera and film some.  Will post on YouTube!

Earlier today, I went to Denny's with Carolee, Eric, Heather, and Tiff and we had our free Grand Slam breakfast. Woo!  I then worked worked worked and prevented disaster here and there.  I still can't find my gate card, so Andrew has to let me in to the apartment.  I will be leaving him soon.  Poor Andrew.

In other news, Sam has a girly "satchel" that he keeps the following in:
<ul>
<li>keys</li>
<li>phone</li>
<li>fashionable pocket mirror</li>
<li>vial of blood he jacked from work</li>
<li>"the pill"</li>
<li>a rubber bouncy ball</li>
<li>a scrunchie</li>
<li>herpes cream</li>
</ul>

In response to this discovery, he claims he was just being nice and carrying the herpes cream for Ochs and the bouncy ball "just fell in there" somehow.  Uh huh...

I'm going to pick back up something I used to do and end my posts with parts of songs now.  To the following, I dedicate to Mark who watched much more of this Avril concert with me than we should've.  I confess I am drawn to horrible TV.


<blockquote class="lyrics">
"I can see the way
I see the way
You look at me
And even when you look away
I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time
Again and again (and again, and again, and again...)
(So)So come over here
Tell me what I wanna hear
Better yet, make the girlfriend disappear
I don’t wanna hear you say her name
Ever again (And again and again and again...)

Cause
She’s like so whatever
And you can do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that’s what everyone’s talking about!" -Avril Lavigne
</blockquote>

Man, that song is so horrible but so awesome in a terrible terrible way too...  it's hard for me to express the mixture of horror and awesome that is the line "she's like <strong><em>so whatever</em></strong>."
