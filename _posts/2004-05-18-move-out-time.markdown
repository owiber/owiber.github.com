After my test is done at 5, Sam and I are going into full scale move out mode.  Anyone who has stuff left in our room has until 7PM today to claim it, otherwise we do as we please. =)<br /><br />WHHHHEEEEE... I can't wait until my test is over... I almost don't even care about my final grade in the class anymore... lol<br /><br />-Oliver
