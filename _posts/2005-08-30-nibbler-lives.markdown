This is Nibbler, currently a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP</a> box (plus a CVS server) and residing at 192.168.123.10 on the most awesome of LANs (ours ;).

Woowooooo! May the hobby code development begin!

On a related note, I reinstalled Bunkey on Nibbler and it works suprisingly well... though I'm not sure how some of the stuff gets updated, haha.  Probably the only person who even knows what Bunkey is is Andrew, so if this doesn't make any sense, ignore it. =P
