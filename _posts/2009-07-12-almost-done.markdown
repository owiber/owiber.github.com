My house work is almost done.  Mostly all that remains is adding the trim between the tile and wood and just general cleaning.  It's looking pretty nice. =)  I was worried about what tile/grout to get but I think it worked out well... it's very hard to look at one piece of tile and than extrapolate it across a large portion of your house.  Here are some shots, starting with the bathroom door I got added to the master room.

Now I'm debating a bit about what to do with the former "breakfast nook" area.  I'm thinking about turning it into a clean "table games" area and going with a predominantly white+wood look with clean white lighting.  We'll see...

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Sometimes I wanna give up
I wanna give in,
I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you, baby
And everything's alright,
everything's alright

When I see you smile
I can face the world, oh oh,
you know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light, oh oh,
I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Oh yeah, baby when I see you smile at me" - Bad English</blockquote>
