The first year I roomed with Sam, he posted this on his Xanga:

<blockquote>[random though of the moment] it is 6:30 am, sun is not up. looks at Oliver.
thinks: hhmm... too bad Oliver is not a girl , or else we could go see the sun
rise together. two guys watching the sun rise is just gay. [/ random thought]</blockquote>

Apparently Sam used to watch me sleep and wish I was a girl so he could share a sunrise with me.
