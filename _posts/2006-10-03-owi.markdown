Haha, so Olivia was telling me about how she tried to get "Owibia" once on AIM to match my "Owiber" and how it failed.  We were talking about how weird that was cause I've rarely (never?) had anyone take "Owiber" before me and it seemed doubtful that "Owibia" would be popular too.  Anyways...

So she went and got Oriana "Owiaba" too and now we're an Owi-family.  Haha...
