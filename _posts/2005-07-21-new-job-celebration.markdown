In celebration of my new job, I shall ask you a question.  What do the following three images have in common?

<img alt="Top Gun" src="http://www.oliverweb.com/images05/blog/B00000K2UX.01.LZZZZZZZ.gif.jpg" width="295" height="300" />

<img alt="Little Mermaid" src="http://www.oliverweb.com/images05/blog/B000001M3Z.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" width="299" height="300" />

<img alt="Lion King" src="http://www.oliverweb.com/images05/blog/lionking.jpg" width="301" height="300" />

Answer: I shall own all three soundtracks in approximately 7 - 10 days. Oh yeah. Awesomeness. You don't know. You don't know.
