In London, restrooms/bathrooms are called toilets so you ask "where is the toilet?"

Also, elevators are called lifts.  I know this because there is a little screen in front of them that has little flags for you to press to change languages.  There's a British flag and an American one and the only difference is "Lift" becomes "Elevator."

And... it gets dark pretty early... like 5PM.

I bought a toothbrush for Oriana because she just learned how to brush her own teeth and will be so happy to have a new one to use.  She can't read yet, so don't tell her and spoil the surprise!
