The rechargeable batteries I've used in my flash are kinda dead I think.  They don't hold a charge very well.  Anyone done any research on good batteries and chargers?  I want something good.

MacBook Pros were apparently updated today... most notably, Core 2 Duos now as well as FW800 in the 15"... the rest is rather minimal I think... nothing unexpected, nor tempting.  I'll probably wait a revision or two before I upgrade.

Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to go visit some random city by myself with nothing planned really except to explore the city with just my camera.  I've played with the idea of buying a random cheap plane ticket off <a href="http://www.southwest.com/ding/">DING!</a> or something for a weekend and just disappear for a while.  Thinking about it, I don't think I've ever gone anywhere by myself... I've always either had friends or family, which probably makes things less boring, but it seems like there's some fun in exploring by yourself too...

<blockquote class="lyrics">"here's another song with the four
oldest chords in history
I guess I lost all ambition turning left on Missouri
I could have made it better
but the feelings just aren't there
my heart is cold and black
but I just don't think I care
so here's to me saying "fare-thee-well"
and when you hear this song I hope it hurts like hell

enamel is stretched too thin
you're beautiful, but not beneath your skin
(enamel, like insect shells
so hollow, like your wedding bells.)" - Brave Saint Saturn</blockquote>
