Bah, it's been a while again.  I am not having much time to do stuff with poor OWeb. *sigh* Maybe someday.<br /><br />Might get new car tomorrow... we'll see. If so, I will be romping around town. ;)  Anyone wanna buy the Crown Vic for cheap, we wanna get rid of it... might trade it in for virtually nothing just to get it off our hands.<br /><br />Someone remind me to give Chad his Florida gift... I still have that.<br /><br />Florida... that reminds me of something... but I can't pin-point it... I think it starts with ph and ends with otos... =)<br /><br />-Oliver
