Viraj has a bit of a germaphobe problem. One time a while back, he was charging his phone, but was scared of the germs on the ground, so he wasted a perfectly good tissue to guard his phone from the evils of the floor:

To teach him a lesson, I replaced it with a fruit roll-up wrapper:

Back in my early days of college, my friends and I had an unsuccessful web comic using a recycled domain of mine, <a href="http://www.mrtechhappy.com">MrTechHappy</a>. It was primarily filled with inside jokes, and yes, used Flash because that's what you did back in 2001.

Well, eleven years ago from yesterday (the 21st), I created <a href="http://www.mrtechhappy.com/index.php?day=020221">Dress Up Viraj Day</a>:

<OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://active.macromedia.com/flash2/cabs/swflash.cab#version=4,0,0,0" ID=comic WIDTH="550" HEIGHT="400"><PARAM NAME=movie VALUE="http://www.mrtechhappy.com/comics/virajdressup.swf"><PARAM NAME=quality VALUE=best><PARAM NAME=bgcolor VALUE=#FFFFFF><EMBED src="http://www.mrtechhappy.com/comics/virajdressup.swf" quality=best bgcolor=#FFFFFF WIDTH="550" HEIGHT="400" TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"></EMBED></OBJECT>

I've been waiting to celebrate it annually for many years now but I've always forgotten and missed it by a few days.

Not this year!

In memory of our <a href="http://www.teetarsauce.com/">beloved Teetar Baghat</a>, I asked people to submit a photo of their phones with a picture of Viraj. We also made sure to guard our phones from the floor. You never know what might infect it. I hope for this tradition to grow and get ever more so obnoxious in the years to come.

Ladies and gentlemen, on this 11th annual Dress Up Viraj Day, I present to you the inaugural Dress Up Viraj Day tradition of our phones on the floor graced with the image of Viraj:

If you'd like to send in late submissions, I'll let it slide this year and append this post to include them. For your convenience, here is a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157632820680152">collection of Viraj photos to choose from</a>.

As Viraj would say it, "squirt yeah!"
