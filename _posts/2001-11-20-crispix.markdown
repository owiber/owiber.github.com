That's cereal...and there's many more boxes of cereal in this room. Chad your room is disgusting you know that? There's always a different odor every time you walk in. I think the cleanest thing in here, is the new package of SOCKS that you have yet opened.  See? your room is so messy u can't even find bowls. Are you sure you even have bowls??<br /><br />-Nancy
