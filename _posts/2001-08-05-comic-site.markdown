Wellllll, the poll seems to be pretty one sided... and I think, if all of the regular visitors left that haven't voted voted for the same thing not coconutcomics.com, it still wouldn't make a difference =)  I'm going to register the domain and sign up for ADDR (web hosting service... the one Olivers using =)) sometime this week I believe.  Butttt!  First, I'm curious on who's interested in doing comics on this site.  I'm going to try not to force anyone into doing it by assuming... so I'm going to let you post yes/no here.  Of course, if in my head, I hope you do, if you don't post here or say no, I'm going to bug you incessantly for it...<br /><br />-Minix
