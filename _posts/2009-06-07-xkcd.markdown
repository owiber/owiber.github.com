I've been going through older <a href="http://www.xkcd.com">xkcd</a> comics lately and happened upon this gem:

<a href="http://xkcd.com/178/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/not_really_into_pokemon.png" alt="xkcd comic"></a>

I've now resolved to use it whenever I can remember:

I've also been going through photos and have come to a new realization about how much a quality L lens compares favorably against a non-L lens.  This one's a Canon 100 f/2.8 Macro, pretty much straight from camera:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/3601892329/" title="LensDemo-001 (by owiber)"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3634/3601892329_5de1eec750.jpg" title="LensDemo-001 (by owiber)" alt="LensDemo-001 (by owiber)" width="334" height="500" /></a>

And this one is the Canon 85 f/1.2L, again without any post-processing (other than converting to JPEG from RAW):

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/3601892443/" title="LensDemo-002 (by owiber)"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2455/3601892443_ca11318a3d.jpg" title="LensDemo-002 (by owiber)" alt="LensDemo-002 (by owiber)" width="500" height="334" /></a>

Notice the much better contrast and colors?  That'll be the last time I use my 100mm over the 85mm for its reach... time to get a 70-200 f/2.8L IS!  Haha... =p
