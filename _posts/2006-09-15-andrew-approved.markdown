I think I'm on a roll here.  Andrew'll be so proud of me.  I think pictures will do:

Haha, when I bought it, I got Tetris DS too and the guy said "you sure you don't want Super Princess Peach?"  Then,  I went to check out and the guy there said "this isn't for you, I hope."

"Yes, yes it is." =)

Before picking up the pinkness, Mark and I went to Mangia's and ate a whole medium deep dish by ourselves.  I'm quite stuffed...
