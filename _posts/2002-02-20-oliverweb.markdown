Ugh, I know I know... OWeb's been dead lately. I've kinda run into a problem... whenever I feel creative, I try to invest that creativity into <a href=http://www.mrtechhappy.com>MrTechHappy</a>. Which is good and all, except that I run out of ideas for OWeb. =/<br /><br />Well, I do have my camera again, so I guess I can put up more pics, but I'm just going to go now after I've talked a bit here about how neglected OWeb's become. =)<br /><br />I need ideas... hmmm...<br /><br />-Oliver
