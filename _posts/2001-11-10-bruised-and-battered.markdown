So here you go. <br />"Guess how much money I've spent since weezer? A WHOLE LOT. I would say i've spent over 500 bucks. Well i payed 150 for the concert. I bought maybe 80 bucks worth of merchandise while i was there. And i bought a whole lotta cds and who knows how many singles. and i just bought tickets to their concert. and 5 iron frenzy. where di di...oh yeah aaron howard.
