I went looking for a Firewire cable for Mac to Mac target disk mode usage today and hit up Wal-Mart and Radio Shack.  I went to an HEB Plus! too, but wasn't really expecting them to have it... they had pretty much the same selection as Wal-Mart and Radio Shack though.  None of them had 6-pin to 6-pin Firewire cables.

The guy at Radio Shack that tried to help me didn't even know what Firewire was.  He asked me what it was used for and when I replied "computers," he asked me what it plugged into and I replied "uhh... Firewire ports."  After that, he asked me if it was an internal or external cable.  At that point, I probably gave him a face that said "move out of my way and let me look for it myself since you obviously don't know what I'm talking about" so he just pointed me towards the computer cables section.

Is Firewire really that rare now?  Shouldn't at least <em>Radio Shack</em> have them?

I finally ventured into a Circuit City and paid way too much for the cable I was looking for.

In other news, Kat tells me that Round Rock Donuts' drive through is now open 24 hours.  That is absolutely <em>splendid</em> news.
