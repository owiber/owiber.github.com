When I was a kid, I always had the thought that I'd be dating and/or even married by the time I graduated college (yes, yes, a bit young for marriage, but that's the idea I had in my head long ago =).  It just seemed like <i>the age</i> and so so far away. Now that I'm about to graduate in 1.5 semesters... man, I'm freaking out.  It's not really that I'm scared I won't find a girl (well, I am a little =), just that the "after college" phase of my life is such a mysterious void.  School's all I've ever known.  I've always been around people relatively my age...

Man, am I ready to "grow up?" You always ask kids what they want to be when they grow up and now I'm at the stage where I actually have to do it. Wow.  This past summer, I thought I was ready.  I really liked my internship and I felt like I'd be ready to leave school after one more year.  But... man, I just don't know if I'm ready...
