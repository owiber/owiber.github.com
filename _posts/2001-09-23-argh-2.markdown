Um... well.. yeah... I was playing around with NewsPro and was upgrading to Coranto (the new NewsPro) except... after I did that, I found out that there was no talkback upgrade for it yet... so... I switched back to NewsPro.<br /><br />Only thing is... I accidently overwrited the users file so now none of you can update. <i>Oops.</i><br /><br />Anyone who wants their account back, send me an <a href=mailto:oliver@oliverweb.com>email</a> with requested password.<br /><br />-Oliver
