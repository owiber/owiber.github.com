There are things I'd like to talk about on my blog, but I have to hold back cause I remember how public it is (no, I'm not getting married... I know everyone was wondering).  I'm not even sure what makes me want to blog, but it's kinda fun just throwing out random ideas/thoughts, eh?

I'm digging the cooler weather.  I've been checking <a href="http://www.weather.com">Weather.com</a> before I'd take off work to see how cooked I'd get in the heat, and sometimes stay a bit later for it to cool off more.  It feels oh so nice to see 78째 instead of 98째.  Speaking of 98째... this is dedicated to Andrew, haha =) ...

<blockquote class="lyrics">"You are my everything
Nothing your love won't bring
My life is yours alone
The only love I've ever known
Your spirit pulls me through
When nothing else will do
Every night I pray on bended knee
That you will always be
My everything" - 98째</blockquote>

Ok... that was a little too much...
