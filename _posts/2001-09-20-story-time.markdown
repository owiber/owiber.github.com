Once upon a time, there lived a boy.  This boy really badly wanted to be a fisherman when he grew up.  He dreamt about it every night.  While he was awake, he would imagine plans for getting to such a high post.  One day, he told his father that he wanted to be a fisherman.<br /><br />"Daddy!  I want to be a fisherman!"<br /><br />His father groaned, and after a long pause, responded.  "Son... You know how I've always told you you could be anything you wanted to be, if you set your mind to it?"<br /><br />"Oh yes daddy!"<br /><br />"Well I lied... the truth is the world is a huge trap.  You grow up, you dream, your dreams get stuffed into your throat, and you're placed somewhere with just enough money to survive, and you're forced to stay there, because if you leave, you starve."<br /><br />"No no daddy!  That's not true!" Shouted the little boy.  "I will be the exception!"<br /><br />And the boy tried to be the exception, he did everything he could... but unfourtanetly, he didn't realize, that everyone else was also trying to be the exception... they all got trapped, including the ambitious little boy, and everyone went about their lives with their heads held low, pretending to be happy, but inside, knowing that they were nothing and unimportant.<br /><br />-Minix
