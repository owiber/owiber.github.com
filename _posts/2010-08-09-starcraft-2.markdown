This weekend kind of started with our BV quarterly all-hands on Thursday.  This time we had it at the Austin Music Hall and I took a decent amount of pics (a bunch are of people singing to win ACL tickets):

More, as usual, are on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157624666924316/with/4865562198/">flickr</a>.

We also got Friday off, and I spent a lot of that time playing Starcraft 2.  I finally finished the campaign today.  It was enjoyable, but a bit on the easy side (I was playing on normal, though so I could speed through the plot).  If I'm bored and have lots of free time, maybe I'll try playing through on a harder setting.

A few other weekend events:
<ul>
<li>Heather's birthday dinner at Daily Grill (I wasn't impressed by food - probably won't return)</li>
<li>Step Up 3D!!!!!</li>
<li>Went to Austin Stone and saw Oriana, who ninja hugged me in the parking lot</li>
</ul>
