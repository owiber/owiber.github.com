I'll try to post more later, but for now, here are pics from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157594585164496/">going to</a> New Orleans and our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157594585519135/">first day</a>.  I will leave you with a picture of Harmon and a bunny:
