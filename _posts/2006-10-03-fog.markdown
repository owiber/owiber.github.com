I had to wake up an hour early today for a meeting and I think it really threw me off... I feel a lot sleepier than normal. =/  Anyways, on the way to work, the roads were decently foggy.  I like the way fog looks, maybe cause it reminds me of California a lot and it just seems all mysterious and fun.  That is, until a car comes out of nowhere and hits you, but that hasn't happened yet to me, so it's all cool.  I've always wanted to take pictures in the fog with some nifty lighting, but haven't gotten the chance to yet.  That, and to take some nice lightning pics... hmmm... and I guess I have a lot of other things I want to shoot but don't really get the opportunity to... oh well... someday...

I don't have the time
Babies, get in line
I've got a protractor
Got a stapler now
it goes Ka-ching!
gotta have the math club crown me king
gotta rock the screen with the cosine graphing
on my calculator
If you're up
and if you want a piece of me
wave goodbye and blow a kiss
Cause you can't handle this" - Five Iron Frenzy</blockquote>

Haha, that songs's so awesome.  Reminds me of Chad and I and Freshman year.

Another block of that song is:

<blockquote class="lyrics">"And I am awesome
awesome
I am the awesomest"</blockquote>

I used to write that on the bottom of CS tests I took... haha, I was a cocky little guy. =)
