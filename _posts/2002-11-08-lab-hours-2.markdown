I'm sitting here serving my weekly lab hours (3... hours... of... nothing... well, close to nothing) so I'm pretty bored. I've gone to /., HardOCP, Tech-Report, The Register, AMDZone, Ace's Hardware, Liquid Forums, ... site<sub>n</sub> so many times, it's insane. I've also visited countless Xanga sites and I am now stuck talking to my website as you can see here.<br /><br /><br />Somehow... lab hours go by a lot faster on Thursdays... oh, and maybe if I wasn't hungry, that'd help too...<br /><br />-Oliver
