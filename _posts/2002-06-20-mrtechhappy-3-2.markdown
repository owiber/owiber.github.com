Well, after a brief comic spree, mrtechhappy has appeared to have died... maybe only fainted, i've got my fingers crossed...  but, here's an idea, Oliver, you should make a guest strip for <a href = "http://www.licensetochill.ca">Three finger salute</a>  I would link to the specific guest strip comic where they asked for others these next two weeks, but... it's not the best comic, but think of how many people would then be enlightened to the world of MrTechhappy!  More then a few I tell you... come on oliver, you can do it =)<br /><br />-Minix
