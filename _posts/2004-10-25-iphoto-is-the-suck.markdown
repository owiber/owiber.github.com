I hate iPhoto.  Slow monstrous beast that screws up any sort of organization I would like to have with my photos. Ugh.  iChat stinks too. Apple needs to improve those two a lot (I hear Mail too, but I don't use it, so I don't know).  I don't even know why I still have my PowerBook. ;)

As for the picture, I liked it... so here it is, Wagner and whatever the business school is called. Bums. ;P
