This weekend, I...
<ul>
<li>Played some more Ultimate</li>
<li>Went to Bill & Tonia's baby shower with Ryan and Heather</li>
<li>Went shopping with Nancy for a bit and got a monocle!</li>
<li>Watched Mark play Shadow Complex for a really long time, passed out on the couch, woke up to random "yelling" from Andrew/Nancy/Viraj (playing Settlers), then finally went to sleep in my room after Mark/Ryan left the living room (at ~6AM?)</li>
<li>Went home for hot-pot</li>
</ul>

And... that's all I can remember for now, but I feel like I'm forgetting stuff... =p
