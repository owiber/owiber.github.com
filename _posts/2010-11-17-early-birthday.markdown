This weekend, we celebrated Olivia's birthday early.  I also shipped off Melissa's birthday present and then worked on a secret project!  No, unfortunately, it is not teetarsauce.com... I still need to get to that.

Ultimate was good especially since the weather was still pretty nice, but I'm not fully recovered from the previous week, so I didn't feel quite 100%.  I finally played a little bit of Black Ops, which is pretty fun so far, but I haven't gotten too far along into the single player yet.

I think that's it?  Oh, congrats to Ochs and Weishan. =)
