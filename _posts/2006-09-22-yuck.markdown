I had to wake up at 6:30ish this morning to make a call to India for work.  Man, I'm so not used to this and I'm very sleepy right now so this post is an attempt to wake me up a bit.  My shin is still hurting so I poked around and part of it feels bruised when I touch it.  Hmmm... maybe I should give the running a rest today.

Does anyone know if McNeil locks up their track at night? I have a strong desire to calibrate my Nike+ (yeah, ok... just a <i>little</i> bit of running =).

This one's dedicated to Sam, who gave me this really fruity song that somehow wound up on my iPod:

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special" - Wham! / George Michael</blockquote>
