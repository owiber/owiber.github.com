Melissa took me to Houston this weekend to meet her parents.  I passed out on the way there, but was briefly woken up to purchase something with cream cheese in it... it was tasty but then I fell asleep again.

I had been warned that the Lau household contained two crazy shih tzus and to stay away from the angry male one.  So far I have been able to avoid a direct confrontation with that one who seems bent on my destruction from the way he barks.  Supposedly the pair of dogs is quite infamous and there are a number of people that I have met that now stay out of the house because of them, haha.

Other than that, I have basically just been eating a lot of food and it is very good.  We shall be heading back to Austin later tonight. Tata!
