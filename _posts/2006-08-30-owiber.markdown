So yesterday I went on an 'owiber' registration spree and registered owiber@gmail.com and owiber.com.  I tried to make an owiber Blogger account, but apparently I <a href="http://owiber.blogspot.com/">already had one</a>, so I just made a post instead.  Doing a Google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=owiber">owiber</a> reveals a lot of accounts I wasn't aware or didn't remember I had, haha...

Now I'm not sure what to do with owiber.com.  I could just make it point to OliverWEB as well, but I was thinking something else would be more fun... <i>but what?</i> =)
