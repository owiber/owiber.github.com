Here's my second run... had Elements to go to so I didn't do a full run around Town Lake.  I decided to push myself on that first mile and I think I did pretty decent, but I was dead afterwards, so ended up walking a decent chunk of it.  Probably would have ended up faster if I did do a full run around the lake but kept a decent pace... hehe, oh well. =)  I'm gonna try to improve my one mile time.. it's fun. =)<br />
<br />
I officially will be leading an Elements with Sarah Lau now... a little nervous about it, but a little excited too.  Ummm, that's about all I have to say about that for now.  We'll see how it goes. =)

Ok, large block of lyrics this time...

<blockquote class="lyrics">"I look beyond the empty cross
Forgetting what my life has cost
And wipe away the crimson stains
And dull the nail that still remains
More and more I need you now,
I owe you more each passing hour
Battle between grace and pride
I gave up not so long ago
So steal my heart and take the pain,
And wash my feet and cleanse my pride
Take the selfish, take the weak,
And all the things I cannot hide
Take the beauty, take my tears
My sin-soaked heart - make it yours
Take my world all apart,
Take it now, take it now
And serve the ones that I despise
Speak the words I can't deny
Watch the world I used to love
Fall to dust and blow away
I look beyond the empty cross
Forgetting what my life has cost
And wipe away the crimson stains
And dull the nail that still remains
Steal my heart and take the pain
Take the selfish, take the weak
And all the things I cannot hide
Take the beauty, take my tears
Take my world apart
Take my world apart
And I pray, and I pray, and I pray
Take my world apart
Worlds apart" - Jars of Clay</blockquote>

Haha, I just accepted a distance challenge from Van... there's no way I'm winning this. =p
