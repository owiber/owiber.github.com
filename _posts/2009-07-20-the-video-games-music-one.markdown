This weekend I went to Houston with coworkers and company.  I carpooled there with Ryan, Tiff, and two of Tiff's friends.  Overall, it was a nice weekend adventure, which I would have probably enjoyed more if i had played any Final Fantasy games.  Luckily, there was not a lot of terrible cosplay to make me want to run away, so we were good there.  A few shots from the event...

Ryan doing a little dance at the gas station:

Yay, tickets!

On the way back, Ryan took the Heather-prescribed route and made a wrong turn somewhere so we winded up at a place called <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.272559,-96.493478&sll=30.271966,-96.490345&sspn=0.01805,0.03931&gl=us&ie=UTF8&ll=30.272077,-96.490345&spn=0.01805,0.03931&z=15&iwloc=A">Gay Hill</a> that had a creepy one-lane underpass.  We thought we were going to get attacked by trolls, among other... creatures.

On Sunday, I <em>finally</em> watched the first Bring It On which was playing on TV (I have seen the other three).  I also just found out on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_It_On_(film)">Bring It On Wikipedia entry</a> that there's going to be a fifth one!

She took the midnight train going anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere

A singer in a smokey room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on" - Journey</blockquote>
