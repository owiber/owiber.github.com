Yep, today (11/19/1999) is odd. And the last odd day of your life too. All the numbers in today's date are odd. Kewl, eh? =) The next time this happens won't be until 1/1/3111... so unless you live a couple thousand years... well, ya know. =)<br /><br />And no, I didn't just all of the sudden realize this... I'm not THAT much of a loser. =) <a href=mailto:madfowyo@aol.com>Carlson</a> sent it to me. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
