So I'm just playing with some WordPress plugins and as disappointing as this will be to Mark (when has that ever stopped me? I know... never =), I'm trying out a Xanga crossposting plugin.  Basically, whenever I make a post to OliverWEB, it'll also post to my Xanga and link back to here for commenting and stuff.  We'll see how that goes... I created an <a href="http://www.xanga.com/oliverweb">oliverweb xanga</a>...

This is also the first post I am making with the plugin activated, so... wheeeee...

Edit: Let's see if editing works. =)  Anyways, so you punks who always check Xanga subscriptions can now subscribe to my <a href="http://www.xanga.com/oliverweb">oliverweb xanga</a> and see when I update OWeb.  Have fun. =)
