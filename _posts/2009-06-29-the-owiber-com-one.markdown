I think I'm going to start titling all my weekend posts with "The ____ one."  Sounds like a TV series episode naming scheme. :-)

This weekend was very much dominated by me listening to music at my house, sleeping, waking up with random website ideas, and then throwing together what you see here now.  I'd call that a productive weekend.  On Sunday night, Chad, Nancy, Ochs, Sam and I watched the first few episodes of season two of Weeds.  I also managed to make my way to Town Lake and ran and kayaked a mile-ish.

I bought a water hose and stuff to give my lawn some loving, but never actually put it to use... well... maybe tomorrow...

I also printed out a bunch of photos and put them on my wall with magnetic photo rope I purchased from <a href="http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/magnetic-photo-rope">Photojojo</a>:

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Maybe I'm wrong, won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong
This heart of mine has been hurt before, this time I wanna be sure

I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you, your loving will survive
I've been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you to come into my life" - Foreigner</blockquote>
