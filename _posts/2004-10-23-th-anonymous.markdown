Seems to be the common practice nowadays to bash/complain/scold/whatever some anonymous being which supposedly exists in our world past, present, or future.  So, I've decided to join the bandwagon this time! (Yay!)  I also came up with a new abbreviated title, "Th." short for "Thing" just so you can't pin-point who (or <i>what</i> even!) I'm talking about versus if I were to use Ms. or Mr.

So... here's goes nothing.

You sicken me with the stunts you try to pull.  You never leave me alone, always coming back for more.  Why won't you just GO AWAY?!  Curse you and your kind! Why must you always nag at my ear and leave me in pain for weeks to come? What did I ever do to YOU?!  You cause me sleepless nights. You backstab me.  You stab me over and over and over again. Mosquito, this I swear... I shall <a href="http://janim.net/flash-games/mosquito/mosquito-flash-game.html">destroy you</a>!!! (high score: 1535 after a few min of playing)

Oops... kinda messed up that anonymous part of it. ;)
