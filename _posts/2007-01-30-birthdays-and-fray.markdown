Happy birthday, <strike>Kathy</strike> Katherine! (decided to be nice since it's your birthday =)

Went to see The Fray with a bunch of people yesterday and it was enjoyable.  I passed out while the opening band was playing, but it was a really nice nap. =)  A few songs after The Fray started, I realized I really wanted to take pictures of the lights and stage, so I ran out of the Erwin Center to grab my 5D.  I think I got some pretty good shots, but I'll have to go through them later today or tomorrow or something (along with David Crowder and Wes pics).

I also subjected Oriana to really loud Celine Dion in the car with the windows down while waiting to get out of the parking lot.  I think she enjoyed it immensely. >=)

Okay, that is all.   Pics to follow... eventually.

Doh, I just realized I need to process the pics from Sean's wedding too!
