I sit alone, staring foreward<br />The bean dip has gone away<br />A resounding snore comes from behind me<br />Like Z's gone astray<br />The people, they all laugh at me<br />"You are crazy," they proclaim<br />"Nay, good sirs," I say to them<br />I am merely lame<br />So I close tonight with a final lesson<br />One concerning my favourite theme<br />Clean your rooms, don't be messin'<br />Cause one day the Grinch will come for YOU!!!<br /><br />-Wes
