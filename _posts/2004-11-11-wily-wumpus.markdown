I took this picture yesterday... it doesn't really mean anything. =) I got a 90 on my EE test even though I thought I got a B... that's handy.  I think I need an 88 on the final (without a curve) to get an A in that class, but he's definately going to be curving a bit, so I think I'm goooooood.  Linguistics is a bit more shakey, but I think I can pull that off. w00t!  I actually might get all A's this semester. =)

Half-Life 2 and Metroid Prime 2 approach.  Can you handle it? Can I handle it? Ohhhhh noooooooo...
