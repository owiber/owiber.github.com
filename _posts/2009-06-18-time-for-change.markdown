So it's been a while since I redesigned OliverWEB and it's long overdue.  I used to do it ever year, but... well, I've been busy.  I'm starting to think of new ideas now though, so we'll see how that goes.  I'm also very much considering retiring oliverweb.com and moving to owiber.com...

By the way, has anyone gotten wind of any new <a href="http://www.andrewapproved.com">Andrew Approved</a> items? ;-)

<blockquote class="lyrics">"And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever" - Reo Speedwagon</blockquote>
