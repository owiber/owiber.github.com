I don't really remember what I did this past weekend, so it's now known as the forgotten one.  Here's what I <em>think</em> happened...
<ul>
<li>Did some misc web stuff and migrated some more sites over to my slice on Slicehost</li>
<li>Setup Google Apps with some owiber.com subdomains</li>
<li>Played some WoW - leveling up my gnome rogue again on Illidan</li>
<li>Went to dinner with Chad, Nancy, and Sam at Texas Roadhouse</li>
<li>Did not go running as planned</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>Profit?</li>
</ul>

Oh yes, I remember something eventful now... UT apparently had a pretty large mishap with my oliver@alumni.utexas.net email address.  I sent them an email but have yet to receive a reply, so I will likely give them a call tomorrow.  If the call goes unsatisfactory, I'm sure I will supply more detail here.
