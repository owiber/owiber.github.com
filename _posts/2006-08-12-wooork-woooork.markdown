A week or so ago I got kinda tired of my job tasks and started looking at other jobs in Austin.  I wasn't seriously thinking about quitting and going to another company, but I just wanted to see what other things were out there.  I think every job has its ups and downs and I guess I was having a down at that time.  However, my group recently picked up a project that's gotten me pretty excited... it's the type of project that made me want to join this particular group.  I think this coming year is going to be a good one. =)

I think I'm getting more used to running around Town Lake... I actually had enough energy to somewhat sprint at the end of the run... getting there... getting there. =)
