So today I ran around Town Lake (the Mopac/Lamar loop) starting on the north end heading east and going south on the Lamar bridge, then turning back west towards Mopac again.

When I got to this part:

I was like, hey, I can take a shortcut and swim across, so I hopped on down to the end of the water and stood there for a while wondering if I should actually jump in.  Finally, I think "what the heck, I can blog about it" so in I go shoes and all.  I get about half-way when I realize that it's not so hot of an idea to try to swim a decent distance after running nearly two miles (actually, I knew this, I just underestimated the distance... actually, I thought I'd underestimate the distance, but I'd underestimated my underestimate)... so I spend the next half of the swim inching my way to the other side.  It was fun!  haha...

Needless to say, after adding like ten pounds to myself soaked in water (especially my shoes), I just walked the rest of the way.  So there you have it, I risked my life for the blog and learned that swimming in shoes is not a good idea. =)
