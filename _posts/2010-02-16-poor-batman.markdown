My Batman keychain has finally lost both of its legs.  Now he looks almost offensive...  perhaps it is time to replace him with my LEGO Yoda keychain.

<blockquote class="lyrics">"In a field of yellow flowers,
underneath the sun,
bluest eyes that spark with lightning,
boy with shoes undone.
He is young, so full of hope,
reveling in tiny dreams,
filling up, his arms with flowers,
right for giving any queen.

Running to her beaming bright,
while cradling his prize.
A flickering of yellow light,
within his mother's eyes.
She holds them to her heart,
keeping them where they'll be safe,
clasped within her very marrow,
dandelions in a vase." - Five Iron Frenzy</blockquote>
