Van and I "just happened" to pass by Andrew's house at around 5AM in the morning (pictures have the wrong time) and we saw this. Oh no, whatever could have happened?! =)<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/andrewcar1.jpg" border="1" width="500" height="375"><br /><br /><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/andrewcar2.jpg" border="1" width="500" height="375"><br /><br /><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/andrewcar3.jpg" border="1" width="500" height="375"><br /><br /><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/andrewcar4.jpg" border="1" width="500" height="375"><br /><br /><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/andrewcar5.jpg" border="1" width="500" height="375"><br /><br /><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/andrewcar6.jpg" border="1" width="500" height="375"><br /><br /><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/andrewcar7.jpg" border="1" width="500" height="375"></center><br />Poor poor Andrew. =)<br /><br />Andrew's away message (5/31/04):

> <i>In one fail swoop, the summer wars have begun.  A signature sealing their fate was left on my car.  I remember last year when we used each other's cars as the outlet for our carnage.  It seems that trend continues and much like last summer, I will up the stakes.  My enemies shall fall to their knees before the fortnight of this first attack.  I will strike back without warning and leave a wake of destruction.  You know who you are and more importantly, I know who you are.  So all I can say is beware, beware of the impending retribution.<br /><br />-Andrew</i>
