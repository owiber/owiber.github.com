I think I caught something a few days or a week or some ago and it's gotten a bit worse now.  I'm a little congested, my throat is a little itchy, and I get a headache every so often.  Yesterday was kinda bad at the end of work, but I slept a little and Sarah gave me this lemon-lime capsule thingy before Elements that seemed to help (or maybe it was just psychological).  She gave me another afterwards and instead of dissolving it in water, I just popped it into my mouth.  That was a bad plan and very not pleasant.  Haha...

After Elements, I went over to Olivia's and she made me wonton, yay sister!
