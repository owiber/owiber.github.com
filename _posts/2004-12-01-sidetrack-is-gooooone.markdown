<a href="http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/sidetrack/">Sidetrack</a> is out of beta.  This means they're charging $15 for it now. Poo.

Rather than give in and pay them $15, I'm considering this the last straw.  I'm <a href="http://www.junthin.com/liquid/viewtopic.php?t=1267">getting rid</a> of my Powerbook.  I suppose if no one wants it, I'll see if I can hook up with Haoming and get him to help me eBay it... if he's willing. =)
