So I messed up the data for my first run with the Nike+ thing.  I guess I accidently stopped my workout around the half-way point and started another, so I have two runs recorded instead of just one longer one.  Oh well. Haha... now I'm debating if I should try to run the whole loop tomorrow or try to do a fast one mile and take the rest a bit slower... hmmm... =)

I've found that if I'm debating about getting a particular song off the iTunes Store, my criteria for getting it has degenerated to "would this be fun(ny) to sing to Viraj in the car if I knew the lyrics?"  And often times, even if the song is horrible, the answer is "yes" and I get the song.  Hmmm... road trip, anyone? ;)

The following song passed the above criteria.

<blockquote class="lyrics">"I'm never gonna say goodbye
cuz I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
and I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad
cuz I never wanna see you sad
I swore to share your joy and your pain
and I swear it all over again
all over again" - Westlife</blockquote>
