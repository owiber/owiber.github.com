Well, TUAW picked up <a href="http://www.owiber.com/2009/12/29/photo-booth-year-bug/">my Photo Booth story</a>, so maybe Apple will fix it now that it's got a bit <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2009/12/29/beware-photo-booth-time-stamps-its-a-bug-not-a-feature/">more visibility</a>. =)  They thanked me by first name reference in their post, though I get no link love. =(  Haha, that's okay, I don't know if I really want that anyways...

I love between Christmas and New Year's time at work.  It's kind of like the last few weeks/days of high school where the teachers have run out of things to teach (since the AP tests were over already) so it's a bit more mellow.
