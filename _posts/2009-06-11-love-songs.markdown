Sometimes I sit alone listening to really sappy 80s/90s love songs because I find it very humorous.  It may be the same type of fascination with pink and other things I'm not supposed to like so much as a "grown up guy."  Or maybe I like to gently tug at my singleness and make fun of myself in a mild manner.  Whatever the reason is, I enjoy it immensely.

Have I mentioned that I really dislike the decline of the blog and how the rise of Twitter, Facebook etc. seem like there's just a lot of shallow noise now?  There's a lot of "social" but I really miss the deeper thoughts and investment that blog posts had.  I feel like I'm purely just blurting out thoughts out there without anything to read and bounce off of.

Speaking of Twitter, after a few weeks of using it, I still can't say it's really gotten me.  I primarily just use it as a means to update my Facebook status.  Even then, I just do that occasionally because I'm bored rather than getting any real entertainment value from it.  I guess now is a decent time to plug <a href="http://twitter.bazaarvoice.com">TwitterVoice</a> (I hear the name was given tongue-in-cheek), which came out of our Bazaarvoice Labs group.

I got a business card from a realtor with a note on the back that basically said "I have a possible buyer for your house if you're interested."  I called them back but got the realtor's boss.  I told them it'd have to be a pretty sweet offer because I just bought the house, so we'll see.  I doubt anything will come of it.  I don't even really know how things like this happen though.  Did they see a really old listing of the house or something?

That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window

There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever" - Celine Dion</blockquote>
