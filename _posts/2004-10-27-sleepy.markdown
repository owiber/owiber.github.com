I am lacking sleep.  I'm tired, but I need to do my homework that might have been due last class period even though the professor didn't tell us. Mark, Paul, and I took Chad to the emergency room last night at around 4AM because of his chest pains.  After being in the examination area for a while, a doctor came out and... blablablabla... so I went with the doctor guy and eventually he said to me "I... just don't know if he's going to make it."  I just started laughing... =)  I don't feel like typing anything else, so you'll have to live with this really messed up version of the "story."  Oh yeah, and Chad's ok... just minus $100.
