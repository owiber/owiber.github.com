Bah! I have finally succumbed to the sickness that has plagued the apartment.  I was feeling pretty bad this morning and I woke up at like 7AM feeling hot and cold at the same time... went downstairs, drank some OJ, then went back to sleep.  Sleeeeeeeep iiissss goooood.  Bah, well I'm feeling a bit better now.  Gotta find something to eat...
