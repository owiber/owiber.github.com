Yesterday, I went to volunteer at ARCH with some Elements people and it went well I believe.  =)  Afterwards, went to see The Departed with Essence and Viraj which was quite good.  Apparently it is a remake of Infernal Affairs, but I never saw that, so this was my first time around with the plot/story.  It was pretty intense. =)  Recommended... very nice spy versus spy action.

*SPOILER WARNING, DO NOT READ BELOW THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE DEPARTED*

So the one thing that bothered me was that they never tell you what was in the envelope Leonardo's character gave to that one girl.  I figured they were going to do something where Damon would follow that girl to her office as she opened what was in it after the funeral, when he realized that she was the doctor Leo was seeing.  Anyways, I would guess that it had info about Damon being the rat, but what was the point of that scene anyways if they just dropped it?  *shrug*
