Okay, so I'm stupid.  Yeah yeah.  lol

Yesterday, I went running and the pain in my shin was kinda gone while I was jogging, and I felt like I had the energy to do a bit of sprinting, so despite knowing I probably shouldn't because my shin probably wasn't fully okay yet, I did it anyways.  Haha... now I think I'm going to have to take a rather extended break from running/jogging because it's hurting quite a bit more now and even when I'm not using it (like when I'm sitting).  Oh, but that sprint sure did feel nice.

Edit: Hey, the pain's subsided a bit, maybe I'll run today! (haha, j/k).  After listening to them on Angell's Xanga a while back, I've been listening to a decent amount of All-American Rejects.  I kinda like how they sound.  *shrug* =)

That wakes up with a bitter taste?
It's a king that we put up there
And he's a short way to fall from grace
It's slowly filling upward.
You can stand but you have no ground.
I hear it from the lost words.
They say it's time that you lost your crown." - All-American Rejects</blockquote>
