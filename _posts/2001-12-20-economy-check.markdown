Since I am stuck at home and not watching Lord of the Rings, i'm going to further analyze a statement made previously by Chad. He claims that pennies are depreciating in value b/c my hair is so abundant. Now the deal was, that for every hair found of mine, I'll owe you a penny. So, economically and logically speaking, if the supply of my hair is A LOT, then the demand for my hair is...uh oh...ya know i think he's rite. *cough* The demand is low and, thus, the price of my hair is low, and therefore, pennies are worth little. Okay nm. I'm just going to go wallow in my hole now. Bye.<br /><br />-Nancy
