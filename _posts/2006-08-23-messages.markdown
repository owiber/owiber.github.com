<br />I like leaving messages for my roomies.  Sometimes they're nice, sometime's they're not. =)

On an entirely unrelated note, I tried the "shortcut swim" again, but this time giving Kathy my shoes before doing so and it went oh so much better, haha...

<i>"Beautiful day,
wonderful feeling,
I feel like singing,
psalms meaning songs singing praises all day long.
Joy fills the weak,
joy makes us strong.
Filled 'till we burst,
songs of praise to the God of the Universe."</i> - Five Iron Frenzy
