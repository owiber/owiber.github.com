I've only been to a handful of concerts in my life and most of them I just go to tag along.  Despite living in Austin, I'm not much of a live music guy.  That said, there has only been one band to make me do something like drive to snowy Denver in November with a group of friends and then immediately back in order to be at their last show.  That band was Five Iron Frenzy back in 2003.  Unfortunately, I only remember a little bit of the trip.  Being really cold outside the Fillmore waiting to get in, not feeling well once in and going up to a second floor area to rest a bit during the actual concert, and then coming back down to ensure I enjoyed their last song:

I certainly wouldn't say I'm a ska type of guy, but there's just that right something about FIF that gets to me. I remember being hit by a ton of emotion during their last song and joining in with the crowd saying "THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU..." when it ended.

Well, <a href="http://fiveironfrenzy.com/site/2011/11/help-fif-make-the-album-of-your-dreams/">FIF IS BACK</a> (!!) and I'm having a good time listening to their <a href="http://fiveironfrenzy.com/site/2011/11/alternate-download-locations-for-new-song/">preview song</a>.

That is all. =)
