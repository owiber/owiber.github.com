Apparently the US decided to warn against traveling to Europe after I arrived.  Oh well. =)

I spent most of the flight reading <em>Ender's Game</em>, which I enjoyed.  I'm liking my Kindle so far! Unfortunately, because I was reading instead of sleeping, I was not prepared at all to stay awake so I crashed once I got to my hotel (morning UK time).  I ended up sleeping way too long and woke up at around 11PM.  I lounged around a bit until it was early AM when I realized I was pretty hungry, but everything was closed (that I was aware of).  I waited until around 5AM and found a McDonald's.  Never been happier to see one.

On the flight over, I sat next to a super cobra pilot who was flying to London to watch the Ryder Cup before going back to Afghanistan.  He told me that the GPS, maps, and screen on the iPad are so much better than what's installed in the cobra, that he carries one along with him (they hack it to hook it up to their GPS antennas on the cobra).  Plus, he told me, they can play music and play games with it while they wait around.  I thought that was pretty amusing.

I've managed to stay out of the rain so far, which I was actually a little surprised about.  I had to wander around a handful of stores before I found a grounded/3-prong power converter I could use.  I've left my camera in the bedroom safe because I didn't want to risk getting it wet (in hindsight, I wish I'd taken it out since I lucked out not getting rained on), but I went to visit Kensington Gardens and ate at an indian place called Zaika which was well rated on Yelp UK.   It was not bad, but pricey.  Probably wouldn't go back.

Oh, and there's a tube strike now. Woo!  Mind the gap!
