I thouroghly enjoy admitting that I should be prepared to take a Government exam, but quite unfortunately, am not.  Perhaps, through the possibilities of statistics (I can randomly guess, yet still get an "A"), it won't be all too terrible.  I very much encourage you all to encourage me as I strive to overcome this frightfully intimidating ordeal.  Despite the fact that should you encourage me I will not receive it until after I have taken the exam, your encouragement is ultimately extremely important to me.  Thanks a bunch guys.<br /><br />-Chad
