I've added the <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/15/index.shtml">15th</a> page to the <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/index.shtml">Pics!</a> section and added another article (<a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/articles/huck.shtml">The Huck Paradox</a>) to the <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/articles/index.shtml">Articles</a> page. Here's an excerpt:<p><blockquote><i><font color=blue>There is one question that plagues us all. "What if Huck Finn was running at the speed of light and spit?" You know you ask it everyday. It is the one question that all of us seek the answer to. What is the answer?<p></blockquote></font></i>Enjoy! <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/articles/huck.shtml">Click here</a> to read the rest. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
