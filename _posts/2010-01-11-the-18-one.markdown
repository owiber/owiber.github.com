Lalala... nothing crazy this weekend.  Ultimate as usual on Saturday, which was a bit colder than previous weekends, but the sun was out and after running around for a while, I was fine in a t-shirt.  We managed to get a pretty decent game going, I think.

I moved <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/4155627909/">my tauntaun</a> to the living room to watch Ghost World with Ryan and Steph, but I promptly passed out as I discovered it was really good at keeping me warm.  I feel like I spent a good deal of Friday/Saturday passed out within the tauntaun.

Sunday, I went with family to Fleming's and ate a lot in celebration of Oriana's 18th birthday.  I also ordered some beef jerky from Amazon. =p
