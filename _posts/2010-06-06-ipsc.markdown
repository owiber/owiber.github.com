I've been working on a Flickr to Facebook photo importer for a little bit and I've got something pretty functional now.  If you're my Facebook friend, you can give it a run through <a href="http://owibercom.appspot.com">here</a>.  It's not <em>done</em>, but it should work, I think... still a lot of cleanup to do and perhaps some better error handling, but we'll see. =)

In a few hours the 2010 <a href="http://ipsc.ksp.sk/">IPSC</a> (Internet Problem Solving Contest) starts.  We originally thought it was at noon, but after realizing we didn't take into account time zones, we found out it starts at 5AM.  I'm about to get a little bit of sleep because the thing lasts for five hours and I hope to make it through it...

The last time Andrew, Mark, and I competed was in 2006 and we did rather poorly.  We're all a bit rustier now, I think, so we don't expect to do any better, but it was a lot of fun last time, so we're going to give it another go. =)
