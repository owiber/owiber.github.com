So I was going to run the Race for the Cure this morning, but apparently, I turned off my alarm and didn't wake up until like... 10 or something.  Ah well.

I went camping with my post-grad Elements yesterday and one thing I learned is to always go camping with girls that like to and can cook well.  Man, I think I had the best food I've ever had at a camping trip.  Thanks Sara and Eunice!  I'll get pics up eventually...

I took the new toll way home from the apartment earlier today.  Man, it's pretty nice, highway all the way to my house (and, incidentally, Round Rock Donuts too ;)).  Anyone know how much it is (it's free for the first month I think)?  I may be tempted to use it on the way home.
