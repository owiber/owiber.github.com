For my birthday, I gave myself a few days off of work (Friday, Monday and Tuesday).  Chad also had Friday off, so we went on a man-date and saw:

<a href="http://www.owiber.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/footloose.jpg"><img src="http://www.owiber.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/footloose-224x300.jpg" alt="" title="footloose" width="224" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2285" /></a>

A few minutes before the movie started, we were the only guys there.  Some others showed up as the movie was starting, but we were the only ones without accompanying females.  That said, I enjoyed the movie, so take away what you will from that. =p

On Saturday, I watched UT lose (good try though, guys) and just did some misc hanging out.  Sunday, I had a birthday lunch with the family and then hung out with peeps again.  Viraj and I finally got around to recording some post-Asia trip interviews for our trip documentary.  I cut a few of the clips together last night and it's turning out well.  I still need quite a few snippets, but it's a good start.
