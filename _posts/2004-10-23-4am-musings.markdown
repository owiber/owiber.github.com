I'm noticing a trend... haha. =)

Van and I went to get some UV filters for his lenses tonight (where we saw that ATM sign above). Then we cruised on over to campus and took some pics in the dark (mine didn't turn out so hot =).  Went over to the Union and had some food with OMan and Alex.

After that, we went over to check up on Sam and his whole TASA Night thing.  There's something about Asian pop that really really bothers me.  The martial arts shows were pretty cool though, as were the Chinese yo-yo things. Hot stuff. Saw quite a few familiar faces there, but I think there's something about large crowds that make me uncomfortable...
