*The title of this post should be read in the same fashion a human peasant in Warcraft 3 would say it.

So yesterday, I received an IM from my boss telling me my demo I showed her the previous day was required in a last-minute meeting.  When I asked when, I was told "very soon" and to "go to Walnut Creek asap."  So... I quickly packed up my laptop and my development board along with all the niftly little add-ons (keypad, QVGA, VGA display, etc.) and rushed on over to the meeting room.

Apparently, we were having a "first encounter" type meeting with a $3 billion revenue company.  It was pretty cool to see the "business-types" go at it with introductions as well as sly marketing maneuvers on both fronts.  I don't think that's something I would like to do, but it's certainly needed and cool to watch people who are good at it.  I'm also not quite sure if this is something you gain from business school... seems like a lot of this stuff is something you're either good at or you're not (though, if you're good at it, business school may give you nice practice ;).

Anyways, the meeting ended with my demo and the potential customers saying "that was a good demo."  *shrug*
