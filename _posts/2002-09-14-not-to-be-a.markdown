...party pooper, but I just looked at Assignment 2 in CS307, and it's quite a bit more difficult than I thought...<br /><br />In fact, it seems a bit harsh of Mike to give this to you guys as the second assignment. Now, if you were allowed to use other Java classes like ArrayList or some Collection types... I could see this being alright... but as it stands... definately a good few hours at least I'd say.<br /><br />I started it about 30 minutes ago and reached a point where I got too lazy and stopped, there are quite a few concepts being used and definately a lot of thought required...<br /><br />So... basically, my point is to get started... <i>ASAP</i>. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
