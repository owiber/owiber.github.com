This weekend started early after Bazaarvoice's traditional All-Hands at the Alamo Drafthouse (we're currently at the South Lamar location because I *think* that's the only one that will fit us at this point).  Some of the crew headed over to Matt and Tara's to chill by/in the pool, then we headed to Trudy's so Heather could get her complimentary birthday martini.

Speaking of the All-Hands, it was kicked off this quarter by an air band competition:

After that, a few peeps came to chill at my place including Ochs and Weishan, which meant that Sam came along too since he apparently has a thing for Weishan and her "innocent friends."  I don't know, that's what I heard, just saying.

On Saturday, I headed to Hula-Hut to chill with some BV folk including Lisias who visits us for the first time from the UK.  I got some shrimp tacos which I thought were adequately tasty. =)  On the way home, Ryan tried to persuade me to play some Zelda games, but was not successful. =p

The night ended with some WoW and DotA, where Viraj decided to not plug in and use his known flakey wireless network resulting in two incomplete games.  At least I got to kill and laugh at him a lot in the last game.  Some notable moments in the last game included:

<ul>
<li>Getting Viraj's health down to red to see him run away.  I figured he went back to his base to heal, only to see the announcement that he died to neutral creeps moments later.  He claims it was faster.</li>
<li>Accidentally killing Viraj in the collateral damage of killing Mark as Zeus.</li>
<li>Viraj dying to cleave attacks by Justin while invisible.  Justin: "I didn't even know Viraj was there."</li>
<li>Mark (who was on the same team as Viraj) having a near 4-5x higher creep kill count than VIraj</li>
</ul>

On Sunday, I woke up way later than intended and just bummed around for a while.  Started going through the Django tutorial again, then chilled with some of the gang and watched The Fly.  Thaaaaat's all folks.
