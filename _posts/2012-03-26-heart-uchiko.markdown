I used to have a hard time answering what my favorite restaurant was in Austin, but over the past few months, Uchiko has solidified itself as one I give. I usually like to get the tasting menu and getting surprised. That means the experience fluctuates and sometimes it's better than others (but they're all really good), but I really like not having to make decisions and getting a variety of tastes that I probably wouldn't have if I chose dishes myself.

Chad, Nancy, Mark and I went to Uchiko today for the start of restaurant week and it was pretty good. I didn't think about bringing my camera and taking any pics, so you get none. =) We went there at 5PM cause they were full on reservations and I didn't want to end up waiting a million hours during "prime dinner time." We ended up not having to wait long at all and they didn't seem too packed. I wouldn't be surprised if they were busier later though, just something to note for those of you who want to go there and may not have reservations (get there early instead!).

Mozilla has started to shed a bunch and I think we've entered into the "blowing the coat" phase that happens twice a year. I've been taking him outside and combing him almost every day and I get a good bit of fur every time. He cooperates pretty well though, so that's good. I've seen photos of shibas blowing their coat that look all funky, but Mozilla still looks to have a pretty good coat (not patchy), so we'll see if that sticks.

MY 5D MARK III IS SUPPOSED TO SHIP SOON. WE SO EXCITED.
