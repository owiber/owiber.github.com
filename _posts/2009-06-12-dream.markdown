So last night I had a dream I went back to high school to get a second "degree" (I think I knew this was pretty much worthless, since it'd just be another diploma, but somehow I thought it'd be fun).  After a class or two and looking at the work I had to do for US History, I decided it wasn't worth it and went to the office to drop-out.  At the end of my dream, I declared "hey! I'm a high school drop-out now!"

Apparently, my enrollment and first day of class (or maybe it was sometime in the first week) coincided with a few of my friends visiting the school, which made for a convenient get-away as I just walked out of the school with them on their way out.  This was a somewhat weird dream, perhaps spawned by seeing a clip of Mark-Paul Gosselaar (aka Zach Morris) on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.
