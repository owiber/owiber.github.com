Well, we did it.  I'm in Youth & Government, which is this cool thing where we get to do mock-trials and there is a huge student legislature and so on...Well I'm on an attorney team as a witness, and we won our first round today!  This also happened to be the district competition.  So I'll be going to state....Congratulate me.  Now, grovel at my feet, knaves!  WAHAHAH...ahem....excuse me.<br /><br />-Wes
