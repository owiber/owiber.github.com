I still don't really "get" this whole <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> thing, but apparently some people like to use it.  It seems like a somewhat pointless merging of SMS, blogging, emails, and IMs and I have to confess that I just don't understand.  I can't say I particularly care though. =)

Anyways, that said, Andrew and I have decided to make use of Twitter by documenting the horrible movies that we watch (mostly together) at Rockwood. Feast your eyes upon the <a href="http://twitter.com/rockwood">ROCKWOOD TWITTER</a>!
