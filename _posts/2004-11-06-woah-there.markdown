I figured since I've gone this far without missing a day in blogging, I might as well not let the fifth pass by without one.  Luckily, I managed to hit the "New Entry" button just in time! =)

Anyways, Van and I skipped working out (my fault? =) to go to Mt.Bonnell with two of his coworkers.  I don't think I really got too many good shots (cause I didn't have a tripod and the lighting was horrible), but the one above's... alright I guess.

Tomorrow, and maybe/probably Sunday, I will be in UnrealEd. A lot.

After listening to the <a href="http://www.roperisdumb.com/">Roper</a> CD for a while, I think my favorite songs are <a href="http://www.christianrocklyrics.com/roper/inexcelsisdeo.php">In Excelsis Deo</a>, <a href="http://www.christianrocklyrics.com/roper/howyourhalofell.php">How Your Halo Fell</a>, and <a href="http://www.christianrocklyrics.com/roper/hellolamewads.php">Hello Lamewads</a> (in no particular order). Their cover of <a href="http://www.christianrocklyrics.com/roper/yourestilltheone.php">You're Still The One</a> is pretty hot too.  I shall leave you with lyrics...
<blockquote><i>This wooden soul is old
It's lies are growing cold
its knotted trunk is straightening
its roots are loosening their hold
So cluttered with debris
this inefficient melody
I'll keep waiting patiently
if this world will ever release me
You love me even though I am untrue
if I was perfect, I wouldn't need you
I'm the object of your affection
You loved me still in my imperfection</i>
-In Excelsis Deo, Roper</blockquote>Tata!
