Well, I'm at work and I would just like to talk about the chair in my cube.  It is terrible.  It's one of those ones that you can adjust the height of, but it will just randomly "shrink."  I have to raise the darn thing like 5 or something times a day.<br /><br />Hmmm... maybe I'll steal someone else's... bbl<br /><br />-Oliver
