Andrew, Mark and I reserved our suckling pig for next week. Woo!  We don't have any idea how large it is or how much it will cost, but we kind of like going into it blind.  =)

If anyone plans on dropping by on a day other than Saturday (where we will likely have plenty to go around), either:

<ol>
<li>Bring your own meat for us to cook</li>
<li>Let us know well in advance so we can buy enough and tell you how much money to bring</li>
</ol>

Now to obtain a smoker...
