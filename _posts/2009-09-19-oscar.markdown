Someone at work is calling me Oscar, and I don't think he's intentionally getting it wrong.  It's happened three times so far and the first time or so it was inconvenient to correct him, so I'm just letting it go and will see how long it continues.  About to keep a tally...

Funny thing is he's not the first person to get my name wrong and call me Oscar in my life.  I think they just remember my name starts with an "O" and somehow that's the first name that comes up.  Do I look like a grouch or something? =)
