Well, I spent the brunt of today cleaning my old room out with the girls in my family.  It was actually a pretty decent time with most of the kids trying to throw away as many things a possible without our mom vetoing the decision (ssssh, don't tell her ;)).  We found these audio tapes that Olivia and I used to make around 13 or so years ago to send to our aunt in California and we laughed a whole ton listening to it.  I think my voice was higher than Olivia's... haha.  I'm gonna make an MP3 out of it, but I'm not sure if other people will find it as amusing as us. =)

With that, I leave you with Oriana's away message:

<blockquote>Macaroni Grill @ 5
&
Facing the Giants @ 7.20

with the RR IBS gang.

<i>now a message from Oliver (Gaugau):
Oriana stole all the chicken and wouldn't let me EAT ANY.  Next time you see her, punch her in the face.  Also, watch out for our sister's (Olivia) butt... it's crusty and you might catch the itch.</i></blockquote>
