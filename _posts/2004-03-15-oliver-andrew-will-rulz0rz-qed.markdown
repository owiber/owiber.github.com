Drewser2001: oliver, should we spend spring break inventing a time machine, that way we'll always have enough time for everything<br />Owiber: yes, that is true<br />Owiber: but what if we don't succeed?<br />Owiber: this is like living your life assuming you'll create a time machine later<br />Owiber: lol<br />Drewser2001: yeah, exciting isn't it<br />Drewser2001: living on the edge<br />Owiber: hmmm<br />Owiber: so I could kill you, and assume I'll create a time machine in jail....<br />Drewser2001: yes, but that's considering I haven't created one in the future and stopped you from killing me<br />Owiber: oh... I see...<br />Owiber: but how would you do that if you were dead?<br />Owiber: what would have to happen is...<br />Owiber: I'd kill you, then later make a time machine to stop myself<br />Owiber: allowing you to make a time machine to go back to stop me also<br />Owiber: so both of us will be stopping me...<br />Owiber: that doesn't bode too well for me killing you<br />Owiber: lol<br />Drewser2001: interesting, I think it's better if we work together and rule the world as one<br />Owiber: yeah<br />Owiber: but I can still try to kill you since it wouldn't do anything anyways<br />Owiber: lol<br />Drewser2001: but what if we fail with our time machine<br />Drewser2001: then'll i just be dead, and you'll be in jail forever<br />Owiber: but... that's contradictory to our assumption!<br />Owiber: that really ruins everything then<br />Drewser2001: oh yeah, we must succeed then<br />Owiber: yeah<br />Drewser2001: ok, so you write the program and I'll design the hardware<br />Owiber: think we need a physicist?<br />Drewser2001: for sure, that would important as we try to defy every natural law there is<br />Owiber: hmm...<br />Owiber: do you know a physicist?<br />Owiber: oh, I know what we can do<br />Owiber: assume we create a time machine and talk to Einstein about creating the time machine<br />Drewser2001: we can go to the future and find a better physicist that knows almost everything about time travel too<br />Owiber: oh, yeah<br />Drewser2001: wow, that'd make our lives easier<br />Owiber: we can create a time machine, then go into the future and steal the plans from ourselves<br />Owiber: perfect!<br />Drewser2001: yeah!!!<br />Owiber: and if we need money, we can go into the future and beg for change... once we get back, reverse inflation will make us rich<br />Drewser2001: we're brilliant<br />Owiber: oh man, this is awesome<br />Drewser2001: that it is<br />Drewser2001: we can't be stopped <br /><br />-Oliver
