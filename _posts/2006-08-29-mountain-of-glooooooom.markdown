I don't know if it's just the weather, the having to go back to work after a great vacation, the missing school-feeling or what, but I felt rather gloomy today.  When I run, I set landmarks for myself that I force myself to hit.  "Just get to the next bridge" or something more important like "just make it to land, so you don't drown."  I guess I felt like that today... "just get through the meeting" or "just finish up _______ for _______ and before you know it, you'll get to go home."

I really feel like running... in the rain, unfortunately, the rain's probably over now, eh?  Oh well, at least the sun's heat is somewhat deflected by the clouds... <i>but not the UV rays, kids!</i>

<i>"You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride"</i> - Daniel Powter

lol... posting that makes me feel like a fruity emo kid...
