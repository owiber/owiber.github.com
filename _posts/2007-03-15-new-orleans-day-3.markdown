Today we went to gut a house.  The house belonged to an old couple that moved to Florida when Katrina hit.  They passed away a few months after and no one has touched their house since it got flooded.  We came in to clear it out and tear out the walls, etc.  The children of the couple requested we look for a few items while we cleaned it out and we were able to find some of them I believe.

It was pretty crazy seeing how damaged the house was.  It looks like the water went about eight feet high.  In the kitchen, the fridge was horizontal and was resting on a counter or sink or something.  I've got a bunch of photos (a few below) on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157600000436901/">my flickr</a>, and Enoch has <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/speedye/sets/72157594583686563/">a bunch</a> as well.  Enoch had a wide lens that lets you get an idea of the overall damage done to the room.
