Gentoo is up and running! I've got a lot to configure though, like various power saving stuff, suspend, etc. etc.  I think I just got my audio working and started compiling stuff... at the moment, apache, php, samba, and grip are compiling, so I decided I should probably let those finish before I compile anymore. =)<br /><br />Ooohh! Samba finished! bbl<br /><br />-Oliver
