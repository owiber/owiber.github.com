I'm at my dorm right now... and its annoying me... my internet connection might as well be 2400 bps... AGH!!  Most pages are just timing out... if I remove pictures I can actually load some things... but not much... <a href="http://www.licensetochill.ca/archives/123101.html">This is how bad it is...</a> I think I'm going to move back home, so I can have cable again...<br /><br /><center><br /><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/thisstinks.jpg" width="374" height="260" border="1"></center><br /><br />-Minix
