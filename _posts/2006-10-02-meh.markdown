I'm having one of those days where I really don't want to be at work and I really don't want to do anything.  I think I need something to drive/inspire me and I feel kinda dead right now.  I have an urge to just go to Zilker or something and plop myself on a park bench and sit there for a while with my trusty (well, that's actually debatable) Andrew Approved iPod.  My shin still hurts a little when I go up stairs and that's bugging me cause I really want to run (I might anyways).

Church yesterday was good, although I have to confess that I tuned out a lot while Gid was speaking.  I need to start bringing a notepad maybe so I can take notes since I probably should remember what was talked about if we're to discuss it in Elements. Haha... on the plus side, I have my post-grad Elements on Tuesdays before mine on Wednesday, so maybe I can catch up there. =)  Hehe...

<blockquote class="lyrics">"I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self satisfied I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows God knows I want to break free" - Queen</blockquote>

Ahh... these songs just don't feel the same without the music. =)
