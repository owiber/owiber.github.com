I did not play ultimate this weekend because I was lazy and slept through it.  Very sad. =(

I went to see The Blistering Speeds at Spider House with a bunch of BVers (Al and Scotty are in the band).

After that, I hung out for a few hours with Steph, Heather, OMan, Sam and Ryan.  I also uploaded some photos I took for a photobook I made for Melissa...

On Sunday, Heather and Steph came over and OMan, Sam and I joined their scheduled P90X exercise which was intense.  I think Melissa and I will start it when she comes back next year.  Sam has also committed to doing it, so we'll see how that goes. =)

Speaking of Sam... there is now a new Samitic.us post <a href="http://samitic.us/2010/12/sam-ni-drinks-too-much/">all about Sam Ni</a>.
