<br />I accidently left Kathy's towel on the beach overnight and we thought it was lost.  This picture isn't of when she found out I left it, but it captures pretty much the same emotion, haha.

Luckily, some kind people at a beach house closer to the beach picked up the towel and put it on their stairs... =)
