Posted these before.  It's a good reminder though.

<blockquote><i>“May all your expectations be frustrated.
May all your plans be thwarted.
May all of your desires be withered into nothingness
that you may experience the powerlessness and poverty of a child
and sing and dance in the love of
God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.”</i>
-Brennan Manning</blockquote>

I think I might try to leave early today... don't feel very well.  I was sweating a lot last night and woke up at one point feeling drenched.  (I'm sure you wanted to hear that ;)).  My stomach is a little sore too, but I'm not sure what caused that...
