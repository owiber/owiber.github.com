I cooked some bacon for Chad and I yesterday and made a massive bacon cloud that filled the entire apartment.  I had to finish off the rest of the bacon today so I did it again. =)

This all reminds me of that one commercial for those dog treats where the dog ran around with "BACOOON BACON BACON BACON BACON!!!!"... I did a brief search for that, but I couldn't find it.  Oh well.  Haha...

After informing Nancy of my Nancy: why are always attracted to terrible things</blockquote>

Hehe, thanks Nancy.
