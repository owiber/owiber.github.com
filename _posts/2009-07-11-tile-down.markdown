Contractors put down most of the tile today, then I went to help Chancy move into their new house for a while.  Tomorrow, it's the Bazaarvoice Technical Services Diablo II LAN party at my place!  Woo!

They also did a pretty good job installing a door for my master bathroom, but I was too lazy to take a pic of that.  Maybe tomorrow after everything's done.  Have a good weekend!
