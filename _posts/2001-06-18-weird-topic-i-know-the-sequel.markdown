Well Olivia wanted everyones opinion on Hanging By A Moment, what it means, and all that deep stuff... I have another song I want analyzed...<br /><br />The Turtle Song, by the <a href = "http://www.mp3.com/ninh">Nine Inch Nose Hairs</a> I'm not sure if all of you are familiar with them yet, but they're pretty talented.  Well anyway, I'm looking for verse by verse interpretations of this song as well...  let me know what you think?<br /><br />-Minix
