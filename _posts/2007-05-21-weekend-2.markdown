I got a <a href="http://www.samsungblackjack.com/">new phone</a>.  Decided to not go with the iPhone, at least the first gen of it.  I've wrestled with paying for a data plan on my phone and the only way I could justify it is if I didn't have to pay my regular internet bill too, which means I need sufficient speeds on the phone.  The iPhone, not being 3G, will likely not cut it, so I went for something else.  Also, since it's usually good practice to avoid first gen Apple releases, and the iPhone is even "more" first gen then say, a new laptop generation, it's probably better I don't get tempted. =)

I've played around with the 3G data transfers on the Blackjack and it's pretty good.  Actually uploads faster than the cable modem here at the apartment (downloads are slower though, but still decent).  I'll play with this a bit more and make the call whether I can go without an internet connection at my next place.

In other news, big congrats to Angell and Eunice on their engagement.  I was privileged to have the honor of shooting the proposal, and it was a lot of fun.  Thanks for giving the opportunity, Angell. =)  Here are pics, now that I have permission to post them... =)  Angell had a fake ring he "accidently" threw off the side of the pedestrian bridge at Town Lake.  That should explain at least some of Eunice's expressions. =)

Enoch, before hiding:
