Weeeeellll, it's October and that means I'm supposed to make a new OliverWEB design.  As you can tell, I actually did it "on time" this year.  I decided to get rid of all the old stuff and so if you want to look at any of the pages/posts from the past, you'll have to use the legacy link at the top of this page to view the <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/main">old OliverWEB</a>.

I decided to give <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> a try, so that's the backend at the moment.  I also pretty much completely used <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a> for the layout stuff, which is actually pretty cool.  I'm waiting for my camera to come in within a few days, but after that, I plan on posting pics and treating this somewhat like a photo-blog.  I'm also going to try to keep the page(s) "<a href="http://validator.w3.org/">XHTML 1.0 Transitional</a>" validated (whatever that means), but we'll see how that goes. =)
