So this past semester, my Elements was blessed with two foreign exchange students, Henrique and Tu.  These guys are pretty awesome and very cheerful and I've very much enjoyed having them in my group to share in our discussions.  They're both headed out of Texas this week, so on Sunday, we went to a Brazilian restaurant to wish them farewell (Henrique is Brazilian, and Tu is Vietnamese -- they went to a Vietnamese place before).  We decided that we needed to do a Chinese place too, so yesterday, off to Din Ho we went.

We had 11 people show and decided to go with the 10-person meal, but since they had no lobster, we got to substitute four dishes instead (!!!), so we ended up with 11 dishes.  Woooot.  It was a pretty awesome meal and I think everyone was really super stuffed.  It was fun. =)

I don't know if this seems cheesy, and I don't think it should, but I'm going to say it anyways... Henrique and Tu, God bless. =)
