I've got my iPod on shuffle right now and it played World Without End just now.  I think Nancy's mentioned the chorus of that song being one of her favorites and I am in total agreement.

<blockquote class="lyrics">"In the soundless awe and wonder,
words fall short to hope again.
How beautiful,
how vast your love is,
new forever,
world without an end." - Five Iron Frenzy</blockquote>

I have a presentation/training to give in a few hours and I'm really tired of looking at PowerPoint slides.

I've got a few things queued up on my to-do list now...<ul>
	<li>VoxVeniae.com work</li>
	<li>owiber.com work &lt;-- still a little iffy on what I want to do with this</li>
	<li>andrewapproved.com work &lt;-- this is going to be good =)</li>
	<li>take more pictures</li>
	<li>get more proficient with Photoshop</li>
	<li>Nike+ XML data stuff</li>
</ul>

Mmmmm... if only I didn't need to sleep...
