Tonight, Sam, Andrew, and I went to <a href="http://redlobster.com">Red Lobster</a> and had endless shrimp! MMMMMmmmmm. I think we each got seven total servings of the various shrimp dishes they had.  It was the hotness.

My new camera is the hotness too, but I haven't managed to take a good picture I really liked yet... hmmm... soon!  I might hit the turtle pond tomorrow...
