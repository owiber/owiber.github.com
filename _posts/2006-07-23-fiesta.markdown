Oh fine. Haha... I went to Fiesta Texas today with fellow ERPs and had fun, but it was very tiring. Haha... it is very hot. =(  I paid $15 for lunch because amusement parks are like that and $10 for parking.  Curses!

I like the Superman ride, but not the Rattler... it is... very shaky.  I have no pictures, but I think some people might have some (and I'll even be in them!) so I may dig them up later. =)

Went back to Nancy and Julie's at 4 something (got to park at around 9:45) and slept for a long time...
