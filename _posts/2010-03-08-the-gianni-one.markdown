This weekend started well with a great game of ultimate on Saturday.  I may have to go buy another set of flags as we only had one extra (we maxed at 19 people, I think).  Weather was great and we had a good number of people, so it was a really good time.  My shins are not quite 100% so I end up messing them up slightly every weekend.  I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to run a the 10K I signed up for in a few weeks...

I believe OMan took some photos of ultimate, which I'm looking forward to seeing.  I've brought my camera a few times, but end up never taking any shots because I'm having too much fun playing, so I've stopped.  Maybe sometime in the future I'll try again...

Saturday night, I went downtown to celebrate Gianni's birthday.  I should have brought my camera, but I forgot as I rushed out of the house.  Doh!  We went to Roy's which was pretty good then I went home feeling like I possibly contracted OMan's cold.  I slept through a good part of Sunday and woke up feeling better.  My Seattle cough might be gone too!

Went home for dinner and Oriana made some molten lava cake which was pretty good.  Thanks, littlest sisterface. =)

Sometime during the weekend, I rediscovered the following and was pleased.  Perhaps I should be ashamed, but I am not. =)

<blockquote class="lyrics">"I never thought that I could be so satisfied,
Everytime that I look in your angel eyes.
A shock inside me that words just can't describe,
And there's no explaining.
There's something in the way you move, I can't deny,
Every word from your lips is a lullaby.
A twist of fate makes life worth while,
You are gold and silver.

I said I wasn't gonna lose my head, but then
POP! Goes my heart.
I wasn't gonna fall in love again, but then
POP! Goes my heart.
And I just can't let you go,
I can't lose this feeling." - Hugh Grant (?)</blockquote>
