I have one week left of freedom.  Then, I get dumped into the big mumbo-jumbo that is corporate America. Wheeeeeeeee...

First off this week, is watching Indiana Jones and drinking lots of bottles of Frappuccino! Then, I gotta buy new shoes and get my car inspected.  But... I'll procrastinate on those a bit.

Movie time!

Edit: No Indiana Jones, we're watching The Professional (international cut).
