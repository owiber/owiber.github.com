Happy birthday, Nancyface. =)

Yesterday, I went to the mall to look for a suit jacket and surprisingly found one at Express that fit well enough (better than anything else I've tried on previously).  It's <i>slightly</i> too big, but it doesn't look bad and it's got room for growth, so I got it.  I was expecting to have to look for hours and hours because the previous time I looked failed miserably.  That made me happy. =)

<blockquote class="lyrics">"All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places - worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere - going nowhere
And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression - no expression
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow - no tomorrow" - Michael Andrews</blockquote>
