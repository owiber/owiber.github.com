It's been a while.  I'm pretty busy nowadays. =)  I had a good long fulfilling week at work this past week.  It's a really nice feeling to enjoy what you do and end the day not dreading returning the next day. =)

This weekend, we go to Sean's wedding.  Congrats, Ruyle. =)

I also uploaded a few more pics from the retreat:
