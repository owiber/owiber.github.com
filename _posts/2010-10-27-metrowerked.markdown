I didn't do much this weekend except play ultimate I think.  There was great weather and we had a good turnout, so it was a lot of fun.  I'm kind of sore still... I think I gave myself some minor shin splints again. =)

For some reason I was reflecting on one of my past work experiences.  During one of my rotations at Freescale, I spent a few months at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrowerks">Metrowerks</a>.  Back in the day, they were known for CodeWarrior and dominated the Mac development scene before Apple started to release their own tools for free.  At the time I was there, they provided the development tools for Nintendo and Sony (maybe still do... not sure) and even had a development Wii at the time (this was before the Wii was out).  I got to play with a pre-release Wiimote by moving a bunch of dots and lines on the screen. How exciting! ;)

Anyways, I ended up not getting an offer to stay full time from the group primarily because I didn't put in a lot of effort into meshing with the team there.  I basically did my own thing siloed away and though I completed my project with positive reactions, the team ultimately decided that they'd hold off on the full time offer because they wanted me to integrate into the team more.  Although they did a lot of cool things there, I wasn't exactly convinced it was the right fit for me, so I wasn't too disappointed with the outcome of that experience.  However, I did learn the lesson that I need to engage at a level other than just delivering what's asked of me to be successful in certain environments.  I'm glad I didn't get the job offer as I'm not sure I would be where I am today if I had.  I look back at my rotation there positively, influencing me for the better, and helping me to be successful at BV.

So, here's to you, Metrowerks.  RIP.
