The Expendables was pretty awesome, especially sitting with OMan.  OMan gives the movie enjoyment+10.  Here are some quick weekend highlights:

<ul>
<li>Watched Scott Pilgrim vs The World (pretty enjoyable)</li>
<li>Played ultimate (I think I hurt my ankle a little again...) then ate at Asia Cafe</li>
<li>Played DotA</li>
<li>Played Nertz - Melissa was on a team by herself and she still won (beating three other teams that had a pair of people, including me + Mark).  Crazy girl... =)</li>
<li>My A/C broke =(... but it's now fixed!</li>
<li>I moved my computer into the <a href="http://twitter.com/owiber/status/21166360183">new case I found at Fry's</a> =)</li>
</ul>
