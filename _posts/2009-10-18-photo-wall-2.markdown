I've finally put up my second wall of photos:

Brook and my friendly coworkers :-) (at least some of them) will be happy to see themselves on this wall! =)  The first two columns are from the food road trip <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157620653714306/">Andrew, Mark, and I went on</a> last year.
