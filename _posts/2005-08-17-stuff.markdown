Went to Main Event Monday night, that was pretty fun.  Van probably has pictures of the event (which he should post, *nudge nudge*).  Nancy dumped her purse on me for a while and made all my coworkers think she was my girlfriend.  Silly Nancy.

We've been playing quite a bit of pool recently, and I'm starting to like it a lot.  I think pool would be something cool to get really good at, so I'm gonna try to do that more often.  I'm telling you, when I get a house, I'll probably buy a pool table and foosball table before a big screen TV.  Shuffle board might be tricky...

I want to get a macro lens and a flash for my camera... speaking of which, <a href="http://fedex.com/Tracking/Detail?ftc_start_url=&amp;totalPieceNum=&amp;backTo=&amp;template_type=print&amp;cntry_code=us&amp;language=english&amp;trackNum=700174078674&amp;pieceNum=">Canon Digital Rebel XT</a> comes!  Oh yeah, I want a hot girlfriend with a perpetual baby panda too. lol
