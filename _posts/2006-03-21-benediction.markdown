This is often how we end Liquid, and at 3AM in the morning what I feel like placing here.

<i>"May all your expectations be frustrated.
May all your plans be thwarted.
May all of your desires be withered into nothingness
that you may experience the powerlessness and poverty of a child
and sing and dance in the love of
God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit."</i>
