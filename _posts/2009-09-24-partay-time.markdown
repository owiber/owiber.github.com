I love how in the following Windows 7 Launch Party video:

<object width="480" height="295"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/1cX4t5-YpHQ&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/1cX4t5-YpHQ&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295"></embed></object>

... there is an old white lady, a middle aged one, a white nerdy guy, and then a black guy.  And they're having nice party snacks and installing Windows 7.  That's just <em>lovely</em>.
