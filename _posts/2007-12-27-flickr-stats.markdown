I know I'm a <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/en/2007/12/13/stats-stats-baby/">little late</a> to this, but I just finally activated my flickr stats yesterday.  It's about time, flickr!  One of the main features the stats introduce is being able to figure out how that one picture with 10x as many views as the rest is getting that way.  Everyone with a pro account can activate it and you should do so asap because some data gets erased after a certain period of time if you don't have stats activated (namely, referrers).

Plus, there's nifty looking line graphs.  Mmmm, line graphs.
