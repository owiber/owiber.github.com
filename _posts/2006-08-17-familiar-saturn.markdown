I've seen this car a few times on my way home from work, but this morning I saw it going to work and had my point and shoot with me so I shot a few quick pictures.  Doesn't it look familiar? =)

Oh, and a close up crop:

<i>"We're leaving together,
But still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back,
To earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground
Will things ever be the same again?

It's the final countdown!!!..."</i> - Europe
