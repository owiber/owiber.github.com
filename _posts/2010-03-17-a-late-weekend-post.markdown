I forgot to post about this past weekend, and since I've been keeping up the habit since the new year, I might as well keep it going.  I figure as long as I do it before the following weekend, I'm okay. =)

Saturday had the typical ultimate game and we had 19 people, I believe.  I'm fairly certain I may need to buy an additional set of flags for this coming weekend.  I also think I'm going to have to sit out for a few weeks to let my shins heal in preparation for running a 10k in April.  I *think* the rest of the day was just me being lazy...

Sunday, went to Vox, then went with Sam to meet up with Heather and Stephanie King at Asia Cafe along with a bunch of their friends.  Hmmmm... then I think I bummed around more and went home for a haircut and helped Oriana setup my studio lights for a photoshoot for her.

So yeah... kind of a mellow non-interesting weekend. =p
