Went to Round Rock to get some good old Round Rock donuts with Kathy on Saturday.  When I asked for two dozen, she said we'd have to wait a few minutes because they weren't done yet... she said this like this would disappoint me.  Psh.  Fresh donut holes, how could I be unhappy?!  That was great news!

Anyways, after she gave us the donuts, she asked if we took "the test."  I thought "huh? what test?"  I was pondering whether we had to take a test to order donut holes now.  Turns out she was asking if we had just taken the SAT.  Doh... lol. =p
