Tomorrow, I fly to Chicago and eat at Alinea!  WooOoOooOOoo!

I ordered a suit from Banana Republic because apparently no one likes to stock 36R's in their actual stores.  I think it ended up fitting rather well (at least better than the very very few 36R's I did manage to find locally).

I was debating about whether or not to take photos of my food at Alinea, but now I think I will.  The most convincing reason?  To make my sister jealous. HAHAHAHA.
