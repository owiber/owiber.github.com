Just got back to my house from CA. w00t.

Uploading some pics now... will upload more later (including the massive  chunk I have from Yosemite).  Some things to talk about...

In-N-Out: Apparently this burger joint got popular over on the west after we left CA.  I have no idea why.  They freakin' don't have any bacon or mayo.  K, fine... I can see not having mayo. But man... BACON?! That's blasphemous for a burger place not to have.  In glorious defense of my beloved bacon, I boycotted In-N-Out, went to Jack In The Box and got a tasty BACON BACON cheeseburger.  Yeah.

I saw Robin Williams in the streets of SF.  Failed to take a picture of him though... but he eyed me the two times I walked by him (I think he may have been afraid I was paparazzi).

Postcards have been sent... but I definitely beat them back home... so you'll get them eventually (those who gave me their addresses).

Ummmmmmm... maybe more later...
