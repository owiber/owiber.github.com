Happy New Year!  I've got a new year resolution or two, but I'm keeping them to myself. =p  What I will share, though, is the awesome pizza we had on New Year's Eve from Arpeggio Grill.  We got a monster 28" pizza with a bunch of toppings for something around $32.46 (just a random guess... j/k, I asked Mark).
