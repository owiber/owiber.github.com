I'm trying to think of words to describe my mood and I just remembered how <a href="http://www.xanga.com/your_shadow">Sam</a> once described himself as "feeling emo"... haha, that just makes me laugh.  I would link you to the actual post, but I don't remember when it was and Xanga doesn't have a search =/. Haha, we love you, Sam. =)

So, Mark, Sam and Viraj just finished a seven or so hour game of Simpsons Monopoly while Van and I played a game of Total Annihilation (which concluded much sooner than seven hours). Yay for the classic games. =)

I'm looking forward to another week at Freescale, I should be figuring out which group I'm going to do my first rotation at. Woooooo. Oh yeah, and I think (hope!) I get my first paycheck too... which is severely needed... haha. I think I'm this'll</a> do it. Some of those pics are so insanely fruity, lol.  We miss you, Andrew, visit! =)
