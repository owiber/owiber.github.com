Just going through some old OliverWEB <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff>stuff</a>. Some of the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/articles/index.shtml>articles</a> were pretty funny... the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/index.shtml>pics</a> on some of those bring back some great <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/christmas/index.shtml>memories</a>. =)  I was just alerted that it's snowing outside... snowing reminds me of <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/christmas/2000/index.shtml>Christmas</a>. =)<br /><br />There are also a lot of <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/yearbook.gif>funny</a> stuff in the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/news/archive.shtml>archives</a>. Thank you Nancy for the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/food/>apple</a>.. aha! remember <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/news/arc13.shtml#newsitem984530709,17467,">HellHare</a>? =)<br /><br />Ahh... so many things... well, I'm going now...
