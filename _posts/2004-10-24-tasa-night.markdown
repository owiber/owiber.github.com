So Van and I decided to crash Sam's TISA booth thing at TASA Night (or whatever it's called) and ended up staying quite a while.  I think I blogged about that a bit before.  Anyways, here are some pics. =)  Above, Braden (aka RADEN - THUNDER GOD!).

Sorry to the people in the jump castle thing, I didn't really get any good pics except for this one of it falling over. =)

Paul showed up later after he got off of work...

Umm... I guess that's it for now. =)
