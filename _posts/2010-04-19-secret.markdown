Hah!   Okay, I really don't have anything juicy to hide, but I'm not particularly in the blogging mood, so you will have to live with not knowing what I did this weekend. =p  I just feel like I have to hit my weekend blog post quota...

This coming week is the <a href="http://www.socialcommercesummit.com/">Social Commerce Summit</a> which I am shooting again.  Hopefully my ankle is up to the task (I think it should be as long as I don't do anything crazy).  I haven't done a good amount of shooting in a while, so it'll be nice to spend a decent chunk of time with my camera again.

Now that I have rewarded you with a boring blog post with misleading title, I will now say goodbye.  Hah!
