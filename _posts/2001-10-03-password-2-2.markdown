Well, the password's gone... although the password check is still active on the old comment pages... *sigh* and there's no way I'm going through all of those to fix them... or spending the time to download them all, filter out the code and reuploading them...<br /><br />So you'll have to live with my lame work-around of the password thing by clicking one extra button once before looking at one of those pages. Don't worry though, future ones (from now on I think) won't be affected... only the older ones...<br /><br />-Oliver
