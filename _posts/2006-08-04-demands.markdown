Life just seems to get more demanding as you get older (then maybe less so after a certain time? like when all your kids are moved out? =), and I think the following is proof.  I went to eat at Thomas' Super Buffet today and got a fortune cookie that read:

> <i>You are capable, competent, creative, careful.  Prove it.</i>

WHAT?! Since when did I have to <i>prove</i> anything to a <i>fortune cookie</i>?!  Jeez...
