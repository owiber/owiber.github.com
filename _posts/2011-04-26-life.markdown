It was pretty moving as I think we can all connect with the pain of loss. Sometimes it's good to cry, ya know?

The Bazaarvoice crew lost one of our young implementation engineers this weekend to a <a href="http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2011/04/26/bicyclist_killed_in_hitandrun.html">stupid hit and run</a>.  If you have any information, please contact APD. I didn't know him very well, but from the small bit of time I worked with him, I know the loss of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/runciman">Andrew Runciman</a> will be felt at BV, so I can only imagine the loss felt by his friends and family. Prayers to you all.
