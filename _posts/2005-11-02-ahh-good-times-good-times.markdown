I'm yanking this from McNeil's website because I like it and I should like to save it for future reference. =)
<blockquote>New Look!

MCNEIL HIGH SCHOOL - After staring at the same old boring layout for the past four years, Computer Club President, Oliver W. finally made it a Computer Club project to redesign the whole shebang. "Well, seeing that Computer Club really hasn't done anything in the past few years, I thought that this would be a nice thing to do... I guess," Oliver stated with a smile.

Even though the initial design/concept was created a few months ago, Computer Club members (mostly the officers) were busy procrastinating like good Seniors should (that was not a comment endorsed by McNeil high school - purely the humble opinion of Computer Club... at least its officers), Oliver W. and Van N. spent a weekend in front of the computer after eating some pizza and playing some games to make... this. "You like?... You like?" Van asks while having a short memory lapse.

Although the site does have a new look and design, much of the content is still very old or nonexistent. "There's like... nothing there," Van commented. As a result, Computer Club would like all club sponsors, department heads, whatever to contact their sponsor, Anne Marie Groden with information about your club/department/etc.

The page content can also be given to a trustworthy Computer Club member who will give the file to an officer, if that be the preferred method of transfer. "That would be most excellent," Van shouts.

"My quotes stink!" Van exclaims.</blockquote>
I wish I wrote like that more often, hehe...
