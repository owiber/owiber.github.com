November is the first month of our new quarter, so BV flew in our international team for our All-Hands.  Because they were here, we also had an early holiday party at the Austin Music Hall.  I don't have pics of the latter event, but <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tuckeram/">Anne-Marie</a> was there in photographer capacity so I'm sure she'll post awesome photos shortly. =)  Here are some of my shots from our All-Hands featuring new BV band, <em>FEEDBACK</em>:

On Saturday, we played an early game of ultimate so that Simon could join us.  We ended up playing for around four hours because the weather was so awesome and Jonney brought us Krispy Kreme donuts to fuel us through the game.  It was pretty awesome, but now I'm sore. Luckily, my shins aren't too bad this week so I guess they're getting stronger. =p

Sunday was not all that eventful except I met up with the Tings and co for brunch at Tacodeli to see Alex again before he goes back to California.  After that, went around eating/snacking with peeps then throwing frisbees around.  I think my throwing technique could still use some work...
