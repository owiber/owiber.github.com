Haha... here are pics in case Andrew doesn't have any.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/revenge/revenge1.jpg" width=500 height=375 border=1><br /><br /><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/revenge/revenge2.jpg" width=500 height=375 border=1><br /><br /><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/revenge/revenge3.jpg" width=500 height=375 border=1><br /><br /><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/revenge/revenge4.jpg" width=500 height=375 border=1></center><br /><br />The pic of the back is kinda bad... but the stuff on it was kind of washing away anyways. I think the text on the back says "I love my mom" and "I want a girlfriend"? I'm not sure about the girlfriend thing cause that was almost all gone, but yeah. The top says "keep swimming!" =)<br /><br />-Oliver
