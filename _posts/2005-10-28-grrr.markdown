So after messing with Flickr for a bit, I've got an issue (with Picasa as well).  What I want, ideally, is to have the smaller version of the images I upload to always be 500px.  Works pretty well for pictures that are not rotated (landscape), but for portrait type pictures, Flickr and Picasa are "smart" and will rotate automatically, however when they resize to "500px" they resize the width, which is actually the height since it's rotated.  I want the width to be resized to 500px, taking into account the rotation.

Any ideas on a solution to this issue?  I'm thinking I could perhaps run a batch on the files and detect if they're rotated or not, actually rotate the image and then wipe out the EXIF (or whatever) that says the image was rotated... but... I dunno...

Edit: Ugh, from the looks of it, it seems like Flickr will resize the largest dimension to 500px (no matter if it's widght/height). Suck.
