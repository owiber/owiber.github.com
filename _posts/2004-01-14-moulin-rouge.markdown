Just got back watching Moulin Rouge for my first time with some guys over at Liquid.  Pretty good movie... I liked the way they mixed the songs together... it was sad though. =(  Although, the only thing about watching movies like this is that I feel like I should have watched them with a girlfriend.  Oh well, I can console myself with the fact that Brook and Grant saw it together when it first came out. =)<br /><br />No more Double Dash for Nancy for a while, I'm done!<br /><br />-Oliver
