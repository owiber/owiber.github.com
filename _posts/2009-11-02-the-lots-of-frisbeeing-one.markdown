This weekend... let's see....

Friday, Al came over (well, more like I took him over since his car had a flat) and we watched a special Top Gear episode where they trekked across Vietnam on motor bikes.  Then, we went over to Chancy's and hung out for quite a while.  I accidentally left a bag of Hershey Kisses there which Nancy informed me later was used for trick-or-treaters.  Punks!  I took Al home and that concluded the night.

On Saturday, I started the day by going to Academy in search of colored vests to use to easily identify team members for Ultimate.  Unfortunately, they did not have enough and furthermore, each vest was $5, which was more than I was willing to spend.  I ended up picking up two flag football kits, which worked sufficiently.  We had a decent amount of people show up at the field and played up with up to 13 people at one point, which was pretty cool.

Later that night, I went to my first hockey game and watched the Stars whoop up on some Chicago team (I think they were the Wolves).  That was amusing and I had lots of hot dogs and some nachos.  After that, we watched I Love You Man, then went to Jim's and enjoyed the extra hour before sleeping.

On Sunday, I accompanied Ryan to the Domain where we met up with Steph and Al and I bought some new shoes to replace my pair of worn out fancy ones.  I found a pair of the exact same style I was replacing and I thought that would make my decision really easy, but it turned out they didn't have my size, so I had to pick another.  So much for mindless shopping.  Went home and back to the field to practice throwing the frisbee more with a handful of peeps.  I worked on my backhand throw quite a bit which I am satisfied with my progress there... I ended up bruising my hand though so now it hurts to open the door and use the scroll wheel on my mouse.  Oh well, that's signs of a good day in the field. =)

That's all I can think of for now... tata!
