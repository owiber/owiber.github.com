Well, I guess I'm at a once a month cadence of blog posts. My builder is supposedly still on track for a September 30th closing date. *cross fingers* I'll be picking up boxes and starting to pack this weekend. Wooo!

Mass Rel has "MR Nights" every Tuesday where a bunch of us (mostly devs, but not limited to) hang out late and we invite outsiders to join us at the office (or somewhere else nearby). A week ago, I had a bunch of my old BV team over and it was good to work late with them again, even if it wasn't on the same stuff. =) That team meshed together in a way that will be hard to replicate and I'm starting to appreciate the experience more as I reflect on it. We've since scattered into the winds, so it's likely to be a unique experience, though I'm optimistic to have other positive unique experiences in the future. =) That's also not to knock on my time at MR thus far at all. I'm having a pretty good time there too.

I swear, it's not me that picked the music:

I really want to make a duckling.js but I have no idea what to make it do so the minified version can be called ugly.duckling.js. Someone help me with ideas.

On the MTG front, I'm really looking forward to Theros. It seems pretty fun so far from the spoilers. I've been avoiding going to drafts of M14 because it's so boring after having RTR block.

And... sibling hangout!
