The dinner conversation today somehow drifted into some aspects I look for in a girl, or that I think complement me well.  I'm not going to get into that, but it's led my brain to ponder similar topics in my now almost "ritual" solo-time right before I go to sleep (which coincidentally is also my blog time).  I'm not one to jump on many bandwagons, much less reading popular "Christian novels," but I've at least had a summary of "Love Languages" despite not reading the book on the topic.  So I was thinking about what my love languages were and on the receiving end, it's probably words of affirmation, quality time, and touch.  On the giving side, it's pretty similar except for touch, which is interesting I think.

I'm not really one that shows affection by touch very often outside of a joking manner (Sam and Viraj, I'm looking at you ;-)), but I think a hug goes a long way for me.  When I'm feeling a bit mellow/down, I find myself wanting a good hug.  Interestingly, I think this works better coming from a girl (not necessarily one I have a crush on or anything, just a female friend, etc.), but I'm not entirely sure why.  Maybe it's just that I'm generally more used to hugs from girls than guys having two sisters and no brothers, or maybe it's just due to society and guys don't really give hugs. It's gotta be in the right context though... this is not a plea to hug me. =p

I'm pretty confident that affirmation is one that I both give and take, but I'm a bit more iffy on quality time.  I put a lot of time into anything I care about, but if I don't, it doesn't necessarily mean I don't care about it, so I'm not sure if this counts as much.  I also don't necessarily have to be given it to feel like I matter to a person, so yeah...

I don't think this mental exercise has helped me in any way other than cure a few minutes of boredom, and I hope it did the same for you, haha...

<blockquote class="lyrics">"She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine" - Guns N' Roses</blockquote>

Lyrics have nothing to do with this post (and they generally don't), they're just usually a song I'm fond of listening to at the time.  I feel like I need to be careful, particularly when the song mentions a girl or something like that (they <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/2009/06/10/love-songs/">often do</a> :-)), but maybe I'm being too paranoid. ;-)
