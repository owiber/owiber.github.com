As many of you will know, the temps dropped to the lower 40's and the wind picked up to the mid 20MPH with gusts up to 45MPH.  Well, that didn't stop us from playing Ultimate and we got in a solid few hours of game time, which was pretty impressive.  The hot shower I took afterwards felt awesome and I discovered a number of bruises on my hand once the feeling returned to them.

We finally got our first frisbee casualty today as the disc we've been playing with finally gave out.  Time to buy a new one (or two...)!

Now I think I will take a nap...
