Went Christmas shopping yesterday with mostly Van... we drove all the way down to Barton Creek for mainly Cinnabons... hehe.... oh, we did get Megan's present there though.<br /><br /><b>Highlights:</b>

> Van and I walked into 5-7-9 and some girl gave us some really weird looks...<br /><br />We missed the Mopac exit off of 183, so we tried to make up for it by going on Lamar, then we took an exit here and an exit there, a turn here and a turn there... and ended up zig-zagging Lamar about 3 or 4 times or something like that<br /><br />We missed the exit to go to Barton Creek, so I used my superior directional instinct to make the correct turns to get back to where we needed to go... =)<br /><br />We got Nancy a good gift. =D<br /><br />Chad's isn't bad either... hehe...<br /><br />I thought about getting Viraj another cow calendar, but got cheep... ah well...

<br />K, I gotta get dressed...<br /><br />-Oliver
