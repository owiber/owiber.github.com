I think my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Teacher_is_an_Alien">brains have been fried</a>.  As I was walking to my car, the song <i>Don't Dream It's Over</i> pop into my head (particularly the "hey now, hey now" part)... which is kinda strange because I'm not particularly fond of the song... and then as I turned on my car, that exact part was playing on the radio.  As I stared at my dash a bit shocked, I reached the only logical conclusion possible:  there are aliens, one was my teacher, he fried my brains, and now I can pick up radio in my head.  Yup.  That is all.
