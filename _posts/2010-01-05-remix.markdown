Elyse posted this and I thought it was pretty cool (I don't care if you like or dislike the pop of 2009 =p).  It actually makes me feel nostalgic a bit.

My littlest sister turns 18 this weekend, which is a bit crazy.  I still make fun of her by asking her if she knows how to read yet, but here she is <a href="http://theoster.tumblr.com/">writing all kinds of stuff</a>.  I remember when I was 18... boy, was I hot stuff. ;p  I liked to make weird faces (oh, I still do).
