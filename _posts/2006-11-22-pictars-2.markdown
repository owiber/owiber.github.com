Went with Kathy the other day to take pics of a family she knew.  Figured I could use the practice.  They had like... eight kids and six adults and the kids were running around like mad.  I kinda gave up on the posing thing cause it was too tiring, Kathy did a pretty good job though handling all the youngins.  I took some decent candid shots though...

I'm really wanting Photoshop to come out for Intel Macs soon... ugh...
