I made a new Paladin in WoW to level with Brook's hunter.  I did the refer a friend thing so we got 3x the experience when leveling together.  I created it on Monday and tonight I'm level 43 with not much effort at all (well, help from the friends).  It's pretty sweet how fast that went.  Oh yeah, and his name is Hunkuspocus!
