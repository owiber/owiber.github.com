This past week, Bazaarvoice had its annual US <a href="http://socialcommercesummit.com/">Social Commerce Summit</a> where I served as photographer again.  It was pretty cool, with Google being our platinum sponsor, but also pretty tiring. You can view my photos in my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157623802080351/">flickr set</a>, but here are a few:

After the summit, I took the rest of the week off to chill and recharge.  I did mostly nothing, but I did cheat a little and showed up to my team's offsite to hang with them for a bit at Crown &amp; Anchor:

Friday night, I went to Uchi with Al, Eduardo, and Scotty, which was pretty tasty as expected then went to meet up with Melissa at Sarina's birthday party... where I spent about 30+ minutes trying to find parking in west campus... oh west campus...

I started to mess with Aperture 3 and decided to make the switch from Lightroom over to it.  I was experimenting with the pics above and also reedited some shots from when I went to Salt Lick with some BVers (that batch happened to be on my laptop when I was looking for photos to play with).  I think the Salt Lick ones turned out pretty well.

I'm still getting used to having control of curves in the individual RGB channels, but I'm liking it lots so far. =)  Good job, Apple.

Some other random tid bits:
<ul>
<li>finally got around to watching Slumdog Millionaire</li>
<li>started using Time Machine for backups on my iMac</li>
<li>looked at reviews for Canon's 1D Mark IV, but promptly stopped deciding it was too dangerous (don't think I could give up full frame, anyways)</li>
<li>watched a few classes about iPhone app development on Stanford's iTunes U</li>
<li>went to the Glee sing-along at the Drafthouse</li>
</ul>

I've probably left stuff out, but whatever... you'll live. =)
