I don't know if I ever blogged about <a href="mailto:planeteersATgooglegroups.com">Planeteers</a>, but it's pretty much just like my Pointless Junk email list way back in the day.  I really wish Google had some better stats on the groups they hosted, as what they currently have is pretty limited (hire me, I'll do it ;) haha).  I believe I have all the emails sent to it saved, so I could probably write something to parse it and generate stats on my own (and I may one day), but that's just another thing-I-want-to-do-but-have-no-time-for.  Anyways, for the time being, I thought these were amusing:

I think the list started when we first got our gmail accounts around when I was interning at Metrowerks.  A bunch of other people were also interning and it was the summer, so the list did pretty well then.  After that, it kinda died for a bit with a pretty good revival the following summer.  That stayed strong and we actually peaked in February (why is that?).

The following is a bit inaccurate, because some people have switched email accounts since the list started (I think I've switched at least two or three times, so my total email count is probably ridiculously high)... anyways, fun regardless:

So I went to the February archives to see what we were talking about to hit that 2000+ emails mark and found these:
