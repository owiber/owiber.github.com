lol, I don't know why but Philmore's Fishy song (I think Chad played it for me way back in high school... man... long time ago) just popped into my head.  Here's the beginning:

<blockquote>Sometimes I wonder
If I'll ever find her
The one that God's chosen for me
And what if I find her,
But she doesn't like me,
I guess that disproves destiny
But I should know better,
The sea is much wetter
With plenty of fishes to see
(For you and me)
And I know my Father
Has scoped out the water
And picked out a fishy for me</blockquote>

I never really got what the rest of the song said cause I couldn't make them out (and didn't listen to it enough to decipher it), but I just read the <a href="http://lyrics.rare-lyrics.com/P/Philmore/Fishy.html">rest of the lyrics</a>, and it's the hotness.

The other day, Van sucked Mark and I into watching some <a href="http://www.spcnet.tv/reviews/review.php?rID=192">Good Luck!!</a> with him.  Man, dramas are so much more enjoyable watching them with Van because he gets so into them.  Watching them makes me feel kinda girly though... I don't think that's good...
