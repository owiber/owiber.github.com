I remember when I used to have nothing to do and got bored and lazy all the time.  Now, I've got all these ideas and proejcts in my head that I want to work on, but don't have the time or energy to do them all.  I want to write a better system of handling the Nike+ data on the iPod.  I glanced at the XML files stored on it and it looks easy enough to do.  One of these weekends, I'll write a quick Perl script or something to grab all that data and throw it in a database, then later maybe I'll do some things with it like have charts/graphs, a button to switch from metric to Imperial (or vice versa), and some other random things.  I wish there was some kind of API Nike provided to get data from their site, but oh well.

I've also got some ideas for <a href="http://www.owiber.com">owiber.com</a>, but not sure when I'll get around to that either... I really wish a universal binary version of Photoshop was out.

I've got the freshest beats and I'm always on time
I'm the baddest of the best, yeah,
I'm the king, word.

Master of beats, and the cross-fader
I'll cut off your hand just like Darth Vader
Step to me,
and you're gonna get dissed, homeboy" - Brave Saint Saturn</blockquote>
