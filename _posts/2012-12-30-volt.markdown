The rumors are true, I got a Volt.

I decided the Accord wasn't going to be a good long-term car for me, so it was kind of pointless for me to be buying it. Dumped it to lease a Volt. Pretty happy with it so far. Going to get the 240V charger installed in my garage. Austin Energy has a 50% rebate on purchase+installation, so it works out pretty well for me.

I probably have some pics to post here. I'll get to that eventually. =)
