You guys need to blog more, I can't keep the blog count up for everyone here.  What am I supposed to do when I'm waiting for a kernel to finish compiling, huh?

I was thinking of cool things to do in Florida and somehow thought it would be funny to bring a bag full of LEGOs to the beach, but decided that was probably a bad idea (I'm sure you can come up with quite a few reasons why).  Then, I thought it'd be cool to bring that bag on the airplane to build something cool on the flight, but realized I would probably drive everyone around me insane with all the LEGO shuffling, haha.

So I think I like the 50mm on the 5D a lot better than the 85mm.  I think the 85mm still seems a bit too "tight" for me for everything except solo portrait shots (which it does insanely well with... oh the bokeh...).  I bought a 50mm f/1.4 which should hopefully arrive before the Florida trip.  Highly considering selling the 85L, if my run with the 50mm f/1.4 goes well.  I know it won't be nearly as sharp... but since I already have the 85 f/1.8 (which is nearly just as sharp as the 85 f/1.2, just can't stop down as low and doesn't have <i>as</i> nice bokeh), I'm not sure if I use the 85L enough to justify keeping it...
