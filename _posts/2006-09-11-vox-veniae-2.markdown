Today (well, technically yesterday) was the first official Vox Veniae service.  It was pretty good.  I'm kinda tired right now, so I'm kinda blanking out on writing more, but I think VV has a bright future ahead. =)

Went to Texas Land & Cattle for Nathan's bday.  Happy bday!  (And Brad too!  why didn't we get Brad to go?... oh, yes, Brad is nocturnal.)

I take weekends off of running, but I get really strong itches to run when I'm either bored or feel like I have a lot of energy... this running thing is addicting.  >=)  Supposedly, as long as my joints don't hurt (they don't), it's not bad running every day... yay!  Oh, yes, also, if some random girl reads this I am unaware of and wants to co-lead a Vox Veniae Elements, we need more female leaders... haha.  Yeah, I know... slim chance.

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day" - Wilson Phillips</blockquote>
