I took the day off since I felt like I needed a good day of rest (particularly since my cough is still lurking around).  I was planning on sleeping in and perhaps being productive and getting my car maintenanced, but I opted to just turn off the "maintenance required" light so I could ignore it easier (it's kind of pointless anyways).  I did, however, get some Round Rock donut holes, bought more flags for ultimate, ordered new checks, and sent off some mail. Now I am just bumming at the house.

I have had an unfortunate run of WwF games and have a longer losing streak (across different people) than I would like... I think I'm playing too haphazardly... and I need to learn more words with an abundance of i's in them... I hate i's.

Itching a little to try to do a small video related project with my camera, but feeling rather uninspired right now...
