Well, I went ahead and opened up the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/>StUfF directory</a> so you guys can see all the files in there... I mainly did this because I get too lazy to update the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/stuff.shtml>StUfF page</a>. So now, whatever I dump in there, you guys can see. Although if you go to the "StUfF" link on the sidebar, you'll go to the page.  I may throw in some surprises every once in a while... you never know. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
