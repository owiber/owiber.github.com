Okay, it's a bit late, but here are photos from Chicago. We'll start off with some from Alinea, which was pretty ridiculous. I'd consider going again in a few years, definitely.

This was my favorite:

The dessert was pretty crazy.  I don't even know what was in it.

It was pretty cold... I think when we got in it was somewhere in the lower teens.

We went to the John Hancock Observatory which was pretty cool.  Nice view of the city.

I think this one is funny because it looks like an ad photo.

The day after Alinea, we went to Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab, which was pretty awesome.  This is the same restaurant I went to in Las Vegas.

After that, we had stuffed pizza and Chinese:

The last day... I don't remember the place. It was good but not memorable.  It did have wood ice-cream though.

We also...

<ul>
<li>Saw Les Mis√©rables, which was enjoyable.</li>
<li>Saw a small play that was put together with various real love/break-up letters.  It was amusing.</li>
</ul>
