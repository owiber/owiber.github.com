I think it's a childhood fantasy of most young boys to have a pet dragon.  I remember really enjoying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jeremy-Thatcher-Dragon-Hatcher-Coville/dp/0671747827">Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher</a> and an assortment of other dragon pet books.  Dude, and Neverending Story?  Yeah, that dog/dragon guy was pretty cool (I don't think I should watch that movie again and just bask in my childhood memories of it).

Anyways, Sunday, I went to Vox with the usuals then went to Estancia for Sam's 27th birthday (happy birthday!).  After that stuffing of the face, I lasted about an hour or something playing WoW at home before I succumbed to the food coma and slept for almost 3 hours.  I woke up to various tweets regarding How to Train Your Dragon 3D, and seeing that it has a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, I opted to try to catch the last showing of it at Alamo South Lamar.  I also managed to steal Melissa away from her studying (I might be a bad influence) to come along.  I enjoyed it pretty well.  I noticed that a few reviews on RT called it "Avatar for kids" which is an easy comparison to draw, although I enjoyed it more than the Cameron behemoth of a movie.  IMO, James could learn a thing or two from this "kids movie" about story telling and bringing out emotion.  I just felt like it had more character and soul, I suppose. =)  Plus, I would take the stealth-fighter "Night Fury" dragon over whatever crazy bird thing that was in Avatar any day.

Going in reverse chronological order, on Saturday, I spent a bit of time at Zilker with Melissa and some of her peeps, then went back up north for some ultimate action only to have <a href="https://www.owiber.com/2010/04/10/cheap-shot/">Sam bust my ankle</a>.  Needless to say, I didn't run the 10k I had signed up for on Sunday (I might've skipped anyways, but that's not the point ;-)).  Wrapped up that day by spending a bit of time at Chancy's for Sam's pre-6th, pre-birthday bash then started watching some Modern Family, which is solidly amusing.

I think that's all I can remember for now... tata!
