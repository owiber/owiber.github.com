Tomorrow is my last day at the System Performance and Modeling group at Freescale.  On Monday, I start my third rotation with the <a href="http://www.metrowerks.com/MW/Develop/Games/Default.htm">games group</a> of what was formerly known as Metrowerks.  They make tools for Sony and Nintendo for their consoles, sounds pretty cool. =)
