Sam, Andrew, and I (with some input from a few others) were talking about "deep" stuff the other day and I've decided to post about it a bit.  We arrived at the conclusion that pain existed in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:16 - "I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing...") and that pain/suffering is required in a relationship in order to grow (perhaps past a certain "line").  So pretty much, the main question is... what of pain/suffering in heaven?<br /><br />According to Revelations (something, too lazy to look it up) and probably some other passages, there will no longer be any pain/suffering in heaven.  What of relationships then?  Do they become stagnant at that point and/or are these questions irrelevant since we can't comprehend heaven and our lives there?<br /><br />I think we also talked about the why there is suffering and if it is a direct consequence of sin.  If so, why was there pain/suffering in Garden of Eden?  Because of Lucifer's sin?  I guess this also brings up the question... were Adam & Eve sinless before eating the fruit?  Or "merely" ignorant of their sins?<br /><br />I'm not sure if I'm transcribing the ideas we talked about accurately or not... but hey, interesting nonetheless. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
