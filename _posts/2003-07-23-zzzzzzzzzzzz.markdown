So, I was going to spam one of Nancy's Xanga posts more, but then I realized that I have a website! Heh... so, I am throwing this up instead of adding a lot more comments elsewhere... although I may still do that if I'm bored. =)<br /><br />For some reason, I feel very sleepy today... I got at least 7 hours of sleep and accidently woke up late (which resulted in me just jumping out of bed, throwing my hat on, and rushing to work =)... so I'm not sure why I feel so tired.  I think I'm going to go home for lunch and take a shower, I feel nasty.<br /><br />I would like to reaffirm that my car's name <i>is</i> still Asif, despite many negative reactions from Ms.K, her sister, and Co..  Also, someone remind me to show Andrew the astronaut picture thing... although, I think I might have lost it again. Nah, it's probably on my desk somewhere... I hope.<br /><br />Which reminds me, Andrew, you're going down. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
