HAHA... I just wanted to write this down so it is recorded and I can remember it in days to come. =)  "Andrew" just played a FFA Warcraft 3 game versus Mark and Van... the tricky thing was, it actually wasn't Andrew, it was me. =) AND, it was unknown that it was me and I even tried to play like Andrew in the beginning to throw Mark off. Hehe. =)<br /><br />Also, I made a "truce" with Mark knowing he thought it was Andrew (so I figured he'd definately leave him alone and go after Van since Andrew usually isn't as good as Mark or Van).  Van was NE so I figured he went mass ancients, which he did. =) The only thing I was scared of was Mark's raiders, but after hearing "man, we just killed each other" (or something like that) from the two of them, I knew that was my que. In go 15 fully upgraded steam tanks from my secret mass production facility to the north of my base and it was over. =)<br /><br />Hehe, now I think Mark and Van are going to kick me tomorrow. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
