Argh, I'm starting to fall behind on blogging again.

I've been pretty busy recently. The new team I'm on at BV has me pumped up. I'm having the most fun I've had in a while. Great team and exciting work. I spent most of this past weekend working on various coding projects (not necessarily BV related). It's been a goal of mine to write more open-source code and this past week I managed to send some code to a project and I wrote my own simple JS validation library (still rather immature). I called it <a href="https://github.com/owiber/toolegit">TooLegit</a>, haha. ;) Looking forward to writing more.

Last weekend, I also participated in <a href="http://rhokaustin.org">RHoK Austin</a>, which was fun.

Chad and Nancy got a new golden puppy, which has yet to be named. Here's a video of Mozilla playing with it:

I've got some pics... they're on Facebook right now. I'll send them to Flickr and post them here later.
