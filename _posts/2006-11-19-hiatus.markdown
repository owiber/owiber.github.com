Well, it seems like I've been on a blog hiatus... saw the new Bond on Friday and it was pretty good.  The best Bond movie I can remember seeing.  Definitely a lot better than the last few I remember seeing because they were too... typical.  This movie still maintained the Bond feel but was also new, it was pretty good.  Yays.

Today at Vox, we're having a guest speaker to talk about the homeless.  We're also fasting today and I'm already a bit hungry... this is trouble.  We'll see how I manage... I didn't really eat late last night and woke up somewhat early, so we'll see... maybe I'll make an IHOP/Denny's run at midnight tonight. =)
