There's one thing to note about that picture above (which was taken in February)... other than me looking all goofy kinda bent over (like someone kicked me between the legs)... and that is that I'm wearing jeans.  I think the last time I wore jeans (before that) was in high school sometime, and after that, I've never had/worn a pair.  The only reason why I wore jeans that day was that our volunteering "theme" was "construction" and construction workers apparently don't wear khakis. =)

I'm not quite sure why I started not wearing jeans... but I've kinda made it a point not to just because.  Is it time to change?
