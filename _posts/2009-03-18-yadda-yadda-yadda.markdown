I've had recent conversations recently about not "getting" Twitter.  To a certain extent, I understand how it can be useful and the examples of it being so are neat, I suppose. Maybe it just seems like more effort than its worth for me.  Or maybe it's just that I feel connected enough to my close friends as is?  I don't know.

I think the thing that bugs me most about Twitter and "micro-blogging" like Facebook statuses is that personal blogs in general have died down quite a bit.  I liked the time/effort people used to put into blog posts and being able to read someone's thoughts more than 140 characters at a time.  I like the historical "diary" nature of blogs.  On Facebook it seems like everything is a constant stream that you lose track of after a while (I know that's not entirely accurate, but it seems that way) and having all that interaction "trapped" sounds less than desirable to me.  I enjoy being able to dig through years of blog posts and see what I was writing about years and years ago without it being locked in a "proprietary" system.

Digressing, one of my favorite things to do in my new house is sit on my couch and surf while I play music with my Mac Mini on my speaker system.  I somehow generally don't get very lonely doing that and it keeps me pretty content.  I'm sure I'll get tired of this music eventually though...
