To San Antonio!

Yesterday, I got some memory foam for my bed and it makes it a lot more comfy.  I think I need to air it out a bit though cause it smells like fresh styrofoam or something, haha.  No more springs stabbing my back!  It's funny because I never used to mind my bed until Nancy sat on it once and mentioned how horrible it was.  Then I realized.  It was. =(

Haha... anyways, I think the memory foam has rectified that problem and now it is comfy... but still not as comfy as that couch downstairs...
