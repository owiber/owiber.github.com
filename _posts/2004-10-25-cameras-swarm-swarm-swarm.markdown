So at <a href="http://www.liquid-acc.com">Liquid</a> today, Van and I both brought our cameras.  Now there are quite a few camera-wielding people there with prosumer level equipment, it's the hotness.  Getting into photography is a lot cooler than I expected... I notice things around the world more than I normally would, and sometimes the shots you take surprise yourself.  Having it strapped to my back with the massive lense is pretty cool too, I feel like I have a weapon I can yank out and DESTROY with. BWAHAHAHAAAA... erhm... ok, I'm done.
