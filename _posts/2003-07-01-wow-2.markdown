Man, I've been busy!  I'd just like to point out that Nancy is <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/badnancy.jpg">evil</a>. Liquid-Missions, work, Physics, and other misc. stuff have been keeping me quite busy.  SMS messaging Tim who is all the way in India is pretty cool, I think I may change my phone plan to allow for more of those (and perhaps MMS's too)!<br /><br />My new laptop is sweeeeet! =)  Like in my aim profile at the moment, here are a few 'specs': <a href="http://www.knoppix.net">Knoppix</a> installed <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> on <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</a> 4 Workstation on <a href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a> Latitude D400 (P-M 1.7GHz, 512MB, 40GB 5400RPM) running <a href="http://fluxbox.sf.net">Fluxbox</a>.<br /><br />-Oliver
