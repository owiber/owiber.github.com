So, I spent most of the day going through tons of <a href=http://www.opensourcecms.com/>CMS's</a> (thanks to Minix for link).  I think it's driving me crazy... but I think I may try e107 or PostNuke for the Liquid site.  Tried installing Tiki, but the Liquid server was being stupid and I couldn't upload the whole thing... so maybe I'll wait to try that one. I need to have a meeting with Karen sometime to finalize and/or redo the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/designs/liquid/04>Liquid layout</a>.<br /><br />Hmm... also found out that I apparently changed my CHI506 class.  I have no clue when I did that, cause I thought I was in the earlier class as well.  Oh well... we'll see what happens. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
