Well, I'm still awake at nearly 7AM because I made the decision to sleep the entire flight back to Austin from London.  It sure makes the time fly, but my sleep schedule is so whacked now.

The Heathrow airport pretty much has a small mall inside of it, so I was browsing books to find something to pass the time.  After looking up and down the aisles not finding anything, I decided with much amusement to pick up Twilight and perhaps become smitten with this Edward character I keep hearing about.  Well, like I mentioned earlier, I slept virtually the entire flight and did not read a word, so I have a British copy of some teenage-girl-crazed vampire novel if anyone wants it (I'm fairly sure the only difference is the currency on the back near the bar-code).

Ryan, somewhat surprisingly, instigated a bad movie watching experience by asking OMan, Andrew and I what bad movies we could watch tonight.  We ended up getting through the latest installment in the oft-acclaimed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_It_On_%28film%29">Bring It On</a> series - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bring-Fight-Finish-Christina-Milian/dp/B002DOBGWM">Bring It On Fight to the Finish</a>.  We're glad to have Ryan in the club.

But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe
Yeah - yeah yeah yeah

Oh Lord
Somebody - somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?" - Queen</blockquote>
