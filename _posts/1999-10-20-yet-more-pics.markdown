I've added eight more pics to the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/index.shtml>Pics!</a> section, making pages <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/6/index.shtml>-6-</a>, and <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/7/index.shtml>-7-</a>. Have fun! =) Oh yeah...<br />Phoooey to you people who voted "horrible" in my poll! =) I'm Computer Club President, which just shows how l337 I am! ;) Should I carry on the Computer Club tradition and do absolutely nothing? Or should we actually do something this year?<br />I've also added the random quotes to the top of every page. If you have good, fun quotes, <a href=mailto:iamdamanfearme@oliverweb.com>email me</a>. ;)<br /><br />-Oliver
