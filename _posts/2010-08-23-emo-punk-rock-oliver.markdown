My <a href="http://www.owiber.com/2009/11/22/fire-place-self-portrait/">last self-portrait</a> was so much fun, I had to do another set.  This time I decided on an emo one.  I originally wanted to do emo goth, but after a (too expensive) visit to Hot Topic, I ended up a bit more emo punk/rock than goth, so I just went with that.  I had the "gear" for quite a while, but finally went and did the shoot with the help of Sam, Melissa, TC, and Oriana tonight (also thanks to Nancy for the hair straightener).  Enjoy!

That was pretty amusing. =)  I think Sam has a few setup shots on his camera he may post eventually.  As usual, Flickr has <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157624662929661/">the rest</a>.
