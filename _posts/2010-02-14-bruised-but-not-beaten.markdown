I somehow bruised the top of one of my knuckles (see pic at end of post) while playing ultimate today, but that's okay because it was a lot of fun to play again.  I'm still getting over a cough, but I managed to play acceptably through it. =)

Tomorrow, Al runs his first marathon! Good luck!  In the morning, I'll be over at Scotty's along with other BVers to cheer him on at the ~23 mile mark.

Yesterday, I won $223 from being in a money booth.  Thanks again, BV!  I think I will use the money to EAT FOOD.

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Saturday night I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sitting in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high

Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman singing a song" - The Hollies</blockquote>
