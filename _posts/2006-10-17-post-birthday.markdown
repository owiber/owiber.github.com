Well, I had a pleasant birthday, thanks everyone. =)  After some early morning work on <a href="http://www.andrewapproved.com">AndrewApproved.com</a> and stuffing myself with some sweet things that will probably kill me someday, I went to sleep and woke up to a bajillion missed calls and voicemails.  Haha, I wish I had saved the ones from Andrew, which were left before and after he discovered <a href="http://www.andrewapproved.com">AndrewApproved.com</a>.

Went to dinner with the family, which was tasty and then went to Olivia's.  On the way to Olivia's, I inflicted my music upon Oriana, which is always quite amusing. =)  Once at Olivia's, I was forced to try on jeans and jeans and more jeans... I think <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/livizilla/">Olivia's flickr</a> has more pictures from dinner and at her apartment.

So... yup, nothing too crazy, but enough little gems here and there for make it memorable nonetheless (like getting facebook spammed with messages, which I'm hesitant to say is pleasant, but it was memorable I suppose).  Thanks. =)  Oh yeah, and thanks to Van for the <a href="http://pckeyboards.stores.yahoo.net/customizer.html">keyboard</a>. =)

<blockquote class="lyrics">"I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know,
My my, I could never let you go." - ABBA</blockquote>
