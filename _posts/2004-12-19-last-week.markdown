Alright, so this last week (as in, last seven days)... three A's, one B. GPA went up a little bit.  Van and I started playing World of Warcraft (oh no!) and it's lots of fun... but man, is it a time sink.  Steve's wedding (congrats! - pics coming soon).

Now, I need to go get some clothes and Christmas presents tomorrow/next day.  Anyone wanna go, give me a ring "tomorrow" (Sunday). AT NIGHT... SHRIMP!!
