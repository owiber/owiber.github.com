Well, Van and I went over to pick up my "new" <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=9430">Canon Digital Rebel</a> last night and I'm playing around with it at the moment.  Expect some photos to be posted within a day or two.

I'm borrowing Van's <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=152&amp;modelid=7306">50mm f/1.8</a> right now, but I just ordered a <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=149&amp;modelid=7337">28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM</a> lens which I should receive early next week.  HOTNESS. It's picture time!
