<br />Went to volunteer for the Freescale Marathon earlier today with other Freescalers... man, it was COLD!  My hands still feel kinda weird, heh.<br />
We were unprepared for the swarm when it came and like locusts in a field, they sucked up our water reserves like no other.  I spent the next hour or so fervently filling up cups as fast as I could.  My hands lost feeling so fast, it was crazy.  I went into Home Depot and ran my hands under cool water and it felt like boiling water... =)<br />
Anyways, even though it was uber cold, it was still a good experience with the coworkers.
