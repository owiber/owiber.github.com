Just finished running and kayaking a bit, so I'm just chilling at my place listening to music and messing around with Python/Django a bit so I can contribute to Bazaarvoice's open sourced "<a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-twittervoice/">TwitterVoice</a>" app.  I think I've made it apparent I'm not a huge Twitter fan, but it's a good chance to scratch my code monkey itch and gain some more experience with frameworks.  If it goes well, I may use it for some future personal projects like... Friends 09 maybe (for historical reference, here are <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/boredom2/friends/index.html">99</a>, <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/friends2000/">00</a>, <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/friends2001/oliver.shtml">01</a>, and <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/friends2004/index.shtml">04</a>). =p

Been in a somewhat mellow introspective mood lately... but I don't really have anything to blog about regarding that, other than to state it. :-)

I stopped by a flooring store today to look at tile and I can't decide what I want!  Arrgh!

<blockquote class="lyrics">"I close my eyes when I get too sad
I think thoughts that I know are bad
Close my eyes and I count to ten
Hope it's over when I open them

I want the things that I had before
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
I wish I could count to ten
Make everything be wonderful again" - Everclear</blockquote>
