Got my new 17-40L, but haven't had the chance to play with it too much.

Went to JM's concert at Stubb's last night with a bunch of Vox people.  It was pretty cool.  I wish I had brought my camera, but I forgot my CF cards at the apartment, so my body and lenses were pretty useless, haha.  It would have been a good opportunity to use my 17-40L.  Oh well... next time. =)
