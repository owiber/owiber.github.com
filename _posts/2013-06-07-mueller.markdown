I'm moving to Mueller! I'm getting something that looks <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157633839275411/">like this</a>, but not as crazy (it's the model home, so it's got a bunch of the extra craziness in it). I'll be pretty close to the new Mueller HEB and will have no more yard to maintain (yay!).

I'm a little worried I'll regret not having a yard for the dogs to run around, but it will force me to walk them, which is probably a good thing. I'll have to make some visits to the dog parks so Mozilla can get his sprinting on. Deciding whether I want to sell or rent my current home (leaning towards selling). Home switching is such a hassle! I'm pretty excited about my new location though.

In other news, I'm also psyched about this new Superman movie. It better not be a let down like the last one.
