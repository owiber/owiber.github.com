<br />On Thursday, I went to do community service with the other "<a href="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/overview.jsp?nodeId=0678433163800794984552">ERPs</a>" at the Heart House which is an after-school/daycare type thing for low-income children.  I really like this picture I took because (almost) everyone looks so happy, haha.<br />
I wasn't originally going to go and instead stay at my cube at work, but I really didn't feel like sitting there the rest of the day (usually doesn't bother me), so I decided to take it easy and go last minute.  Rushed back to the apartment to grab my camera gear and showed up.  Little did I realize that kids drain energy from you like no other, haha.  Compounded with the fact that I had a 7AM conference call that day, I was completely pooped at the end of the day, but I think this picture makes it all worth it.  Yay kids. =)<br />
At one point in our activities, people were throwing water balloons everywhere, and I'm (pleasantly) surprised no one smacked me with my camera.  That would not have been cool, but I guess that means I'd just have to get the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0409/04092104canoneos1dsmkii.asp">weather resistant body</a> so that isn't a problem anymore. =)  (j/k)
