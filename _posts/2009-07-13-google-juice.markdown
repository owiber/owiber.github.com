I will occasionally <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=oliver+wong&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">Google myself</a> to see how much Google juice I've got.  Particularly since moving domain names from OliverWEB.com to Owiber.com, I've been curious how that impacts my rank.  Looking at my analytics data, it seems like a frequent path from Google to my site is querying for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bazaarvoice+oliver+wong&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">bazaarvoice oliver wong</a>" which isn't too surprising to me.  An even better search to find e-Oliver is for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=owiber&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">owiber</a>."

However, I saw that a few of the top results were to pages I didn't particularly own or care about, so I decided to make an <a href="https://www.owiber.com/oliver-wong">About Oliver Wong</a> page with an SEO friendly URL and all that jazz.  I don't mean to seem self-indulgent, but I figured I should probably have such a page to compete with the other pages out there on the internet "about me."  It was fun just brain dumping a bunch about myself. =p

Weekend's about over with now, which included:
<ul>
<li>Contractors redoing house, knocking out a wall, adding a door, tiling floor, etc.</li>
<li>Diablo II LAN party with Bazaarvoice crew</li>
<li>Helped Chancy move into their new house</li>
<li>Biked over to Chancy's (took shortcut under the railroad tracks - ~9min at an easy pace)</li>
<li>Dinner with family for belated bday/father's day</li>
</ul>

I will now sheepishly declare that I have some Taylor Swift stuck in my head after hearing her at least a few times over the weekend due to reasons I could not control... :-)  So now I feel like an adolescent girl trying to rid my crush on the team's football star. :-(

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
What I want and I need
And everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything
That I have to live without" - Taylor Swift</blockquote>
