<br />Spent too <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72057594138098816/">too much</a>. =)  I will concede that this purchase in near wholly unnecessary, but oh is this <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=11933">Canon 5D</a> <i>nice</i>... although I think my camera skills in no way warrant this type of gear (maybe eventually? =).

So I'm done spending for a long time to come (except for maybe a tripod and Aperture/Lightroom)... time to take shot in FF!  I think I'll only get a tripod if Jon wants his back... I mean, wait... I don't have his tripod... Kathy has it... yeaah..... that's it. =)
