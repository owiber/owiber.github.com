It's quite amazing how the visual aspects of Linux desktop environments have improved since I first started playing with it.  <a href="http://www.vbrad.com/Reviews/mayjun00/Corel_Linux_OS_Review.html">Here's</a> a page that has a review of Corel Linux (one of the first distros I tried out)... man was that ugly.  I think I still have the squeezy pengiun that came with mine (though his head is falling off).

A modern Ubuntu system with GNOME 2.12 is now more akin to <a href="http://pubcrawler.org/images/screenshots/gnome2.12/smeg.png">this</a>.  Man, five years can make a huge difference. =)

... Crap... it's been five years?!

Not only does it look better but GNOME has improved quite a bit in usability as well.  Things are automounting, there are more multimedia applications, it's crazy!  I haven't really tried a recent build of KDE yet, but I'm sure I'll get the itch to change soon and I'll give that a spin as well.

Go OSS!
