Going to take pictures at a wedding (reception?) in an hour or two while Viraj tries to nail down some Texas/Ohio tickets. =)  I spent much of the last hour scouring the <a href="http://www.fredmiranda.com/forum">FredMiranda forums</a> looking at wedding pictures and post-processing techniques.  Man, there are some good photographers there (and lots of not so great ones, haha).  Batteries charged, check, CF cards in the cameras and formatted, check, flash ready, check, lenses ready/cleaned, check.  Alright, I'm good to go.

I don't think I take good posed shots... just cause I don't have much experience with it I guess.  I much prefer candid shots I suppose.  We'll see, I'm not sure exactly what type of pictures I'm supposed to take...
