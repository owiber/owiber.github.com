I've added the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/index.shtml>Pics!</a> section to OliverWEB. Funny stuff there. =) You have got to <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/index.shtml>check it out</a>. I've only been able to scan in eight pics at the time of this posting, but there'll be more (very possibly by the time you read this =). Also, I changed the text color to a light grey... how's it look? =)<br /><br />-Oliver
