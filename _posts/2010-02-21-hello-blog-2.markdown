Let's see... there are a few topics to discuss, but some I will not. ;) Sometimes it is a bit awkward to use a very public blog as a sort of virtual scrap book...

Anyways, Thursday, a group of BVers + Sam and I went to the Love Bites sing-along at the drafthouse.  It was pretty amazing.  Unfortunately, I'm not over the cough I picked up from the cold I caught in Seattle, so belting out to the likes of Journey, Queen, etc. did not help.  I toughed it out though through a bunch of cough drops and tea and had a blast.  IMO, one of the best, if not the best sing-along they've got (that I've been to, at least).

Today, had a great game of ultimate where Al joined us again after finishing his marathon last week.  I managed to scrape up my knee a bit, but I purchased pads for my cleats that helped a bunch in preventing my shins from busting again.  Mikey got banged up quite a bit by getting pelted with the frisbee a few times on this arms, and face... then he jammed his thumb into Mark.  Maybe I'll start cataloging all of our frisbee injuries... =)

Spent the latter part of today napping and cleaning... that's it... for now. =)
