Yes, it's time for the OliverWEB Spring Break mini-series to continue!

> <img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/hellhare.jpg" width="150" height="111" align="right" border="0" alt="HellHare - by Wes">...so in order to take over every nuclear silo in the world, BadGuyBunnyRabbit turned into... HellHare! <span>(HellHare a creation of <a href="http://www.hometown.aol.com/holyyam" target="_blank">Wes</a>)</span> So off went HellHare... he started off in Vatican City, Andorra, Barbados, and Tuvalu, but soon discovered... that those countries don't have any nuclear weapons and are among the smallest in the world. <i>"Seelly raaavvvit,"</i> it said to itself. On to the United States of America!!! It was at this very moment that HellHare saw a small chicken cross a small dirt road in the country of Palau, just as a truck full of hay was nearing...

WILL THE CHICKEN SURVIVE THE CROSSING OF THE ROAD?!<br /><br />WILL HELLHARE TAKE OVER THE WORLD?!<br /><br />STAY TUNED, RABBITWATCHERS, AT THE SAME RABBITTIME (well, not really), THE SAME RABBITCHANNEL (well... no), THE SAME RABBITDATE (nope), AND THE SAME RABBITWEBSITE (well... alright)!!!<br /><br />-Oliver
