On Friday night, I saw Phantom of the Opera with Melissa and some of her friends.  It was my first time seeing it, and was pretty enjoyable. =)  Walking around campus makes me feel a bit old though... However, what makes me feel even older is the fact that I have my 10 year high school reunion next year.  10 years!  Eep...

On Saturday, I took Melissa to Lockhart for some tasty BBQ.  I had only previously ever been to Black's and Chisholm Trail, so I figured it was time for me to hit up either Kreuz or Smitty's (which I feel are actually the more well known/visited places).  We ended up going to Smitty's but I must unfortunately say that I was underwhelmed.  They ran out of prime rib, so we didn't get to try that, but the brisket and pork chops were both fairly dry (yes, I asked for fatty brisket).  The pork ribs were pretty good, though.  I might be down for giving them another chance, but I didn't get a very good first impression.  It made me want to do another <a href="http://www.meatcation.com">meatcation</a>...

Sunday, after church, we had a bit of an introduction lunch at Arpeggio Grill for Viraj and Stephanie King to meet Melissa and for two of her friends, Sarina and Helen to meet me.  Can't go wrong with a tasty 30" Greek pizza. =)  That was pretty fun, then I went home, hung out for a bit and passed out for a few hours.

Throughout the weekend, there was Pushing Daisies watching as well... we're approaching the end of the second/final season.  It has also been pretty enjoyable, so I would classify this as a solid weekend. =)

On to the work week!...
