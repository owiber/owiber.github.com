<li>Finally watered my lawn after purchasing a water hose that was actually long enough for my needs</li>

<li>Went to Plucker's with Al</li>
<li>Refactored a bunch of backend code on Owiber.com</li>
</ul>

Saturday:
<ul>
<li>Chilled with Chad for a bit, including fetching some stuff to repair a <em>really small</em> scratch on his car
