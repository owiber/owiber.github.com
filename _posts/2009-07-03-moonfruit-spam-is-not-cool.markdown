Lame Twitter "event" of the day/week: <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23moonfruit">#moonfruit spam</a>.  Not only do I not care about how long you sat on the toilet this morning, and yes, in fact, I <em>did</em> hear that Michael Jackson is dead, I <em>really</em> don't care to hear about some website builder over and over... and over... and over again.  This type of stuff keeps up and I'm just going to abandon Twitter altogether... I already question its worth.  Don't be such ad gimmick whores, people!

Speaking of selling out, I may put Google AdSense ads on Owiber.com just to play around with it.  I don't expect to make any money, but I'm curious how the whole system works.  Yeah yeah, go #moonfruit yourself.

To brighten my soul, but I can't control the rain
That keeps falling
Smile on the outside that never comes in
A comedy, mystery, irony, tragedy
So I scream 'let the show begin'" - Jars of Clay</blockquote>
