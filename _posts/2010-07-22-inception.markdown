I don't think a lot happened this past weekend.  Friday we went to eat at G'Raj Mahal which was not bad. I don't really remember what happened after that. =p

Saturday, we played ultimate and it was pretty hot with not very many clouds.  Viraj managed to drag Chad along and he dominated Viraj who "broke a nail."  Ochs look a fall on the gravel and made his leg really ugly.  Andrew was really slow from his Mark-inflicted injury from last week.  That said, it was still a fun time. =)  After that, we went to Jamba Juice and Sunflower.

We also went to see Inception which was enjoyable.  That's about all I'll say.  You should see it if you haven't already.

Sunday was Vox and we also played a crazy tower defense map in WC3.  Have yet to beat it. =(
