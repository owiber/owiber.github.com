I've been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Irresistible-Revolution-Living-Ordinary-Radical/dp/0310266300">The Irresistible Revolution: Living as an Ordinary Radical</a> for Vox and it's been pretty good I think.  I've had some thoughts on topics it talks about, but I'm going to let them fester for a while before blogging about them (if I ever do =).

In the mean time, I leave you with my past few days in pictures:

Another picture of Wes:

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Try to climb a broken ladder
Grip the missing rungs
And fall down down down down
Seems some time ago you said
This wouldn't last
And now you sit here crying, yeah

Beside your bed
You feel left for dead
You kneel in the dark" - Jars of Clay</blockquote>
