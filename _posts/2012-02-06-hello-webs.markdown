Well hello again. I was going to try to do a weekly blog update like I did a year or so ago, but I have already failed. I definitely want to blog more than the pitiful amount I did last year though, so here goes! I suppose when my thoughts are too deep, they don't make it on the blog due to its public nature... Take that however you want for what that meant for 2011.

Anyways, Mozilla is growing and he's 18 pounds now! He was naughty one day while I was at work (teething, anxious, and/or both) and made two holes in my wall. The worst of which is pictured...

So, now he has a crate that he will be spending his days in until at least he's done teething. Other than that though he's been a pretty good puppy and I really enjoy his personality. I will miss him when I go to Hawaii. =(  Oh yes, I know, poor little Oliver <em>has</em> to go to Hawaii and will miss his dog. How unfortunate. =p

I've also been playing a heavier amount of Magic with the gang, reviving a near decade old hobby of mine. I ended up attending some tournaments and resurrecting my old DCI number, which was apparently amusing to the tournament organizers due to its small number of digits. Yeah, nerd cred! Wait...

I logged into my account and saw some of my records at tournaments as far back as 1999. I'm doing much better now than I did back then, but that's probably more due to the fact that I played constructed then but didn't have enough money to really have a "tier 1" competitive deck. That said, I haven't done any constructed tournaments (just limited) recently. I've managed to at least recoupe my entry fees though and have gotten top 4 in the last three I've went to. Perhaps this is a new career option calling out to me... (joking). I spent some time today sorting through piles of cards that have accumulated on my tables...

I also watched Smash tonight and am perfectly prepared to have Mark call me a fruit-bag again. As <a href="http://theoster.tumblr.com/post/13979531986/comparing-tv-shows">Oriana has mentioned</a>, I apparently have quite a bit of overlap in my TV watching habits to a girl in her early 20's. =D

Oh, I have also started to send my Instagram pics to flickr, which can be <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/tags/uploaded%3Aby%3Dinstagram/">found here</a>. I'm sure they'll still be mostly Mozilla for the foreseeable future.
