I took Mozilla to the vet at the end of last month and he had gained a pound since getting him (about a week's time). I realized then I should take lots of pictures as he won't stay a puppy for long. He's actually really good with the camera and will usually just continue doing whatever he's doing and occasionally looking at me as I snap photos. This puppy is pretty awesome.

Haha, fat looking puppy:

I went to The Domain along with some peeps primarily for Jonney and FiFi's engagement (actual event and photos). I took the opportunity to socialize Mozilla a bit more and took him too. He was quite the popular little puppy there. I had one guy stop me and gave me his email so I could send him information (breeder, etc.). Here are some photos:

"How you doin'?"

Oh, and if you're interested in Jonney and FiFi's engagement photos, you'll have to bug Sam and Kat. =p

Shiba inus are infamous for not recalling well. You can tell them to come and they may look at you but then there's a good chance they'll ignore you. Mozilla hasn't been too bad at this so far, but last night when it was rainy and wet outside, I would wipe his feet every time he came back inside. He apparently isn't much of a fan of this so he got progressively more stubborn about not coming in. Luckily he is a little guy and I just catch him and pick him up. =)

ANNNNNDDDD... Happy birthday, Oriana. =)
