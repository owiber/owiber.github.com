Went to see Ocean's 12 today.  It was alright, not as good as first... a bit disappointing.  My sleep schedule is out of wack again (as expected once school is out =)... seeing as it is 5AM, I think I may just try to stay awake until Liquid.

Hmmmm... we actually played two games of WarCraft3 tonight.  It's been a long time.
