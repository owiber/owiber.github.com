... not really, that's just the song I'm listening to. =)  This weekend was pretty boring as I basically just quarantined myself at home trying to get over this stupid cold/cough.

I skipped out on going to Dallas to eat food, skipped out on ultimate, and skipped out on going to Vox.  Darn you, germs.  I did, however, watch the Saints win the Super Bowl.  Grats to them. =)

I started doing my taxes on TurboTax, but I'm not entirely sure what the best way to handle roommate rent income is.  Not entirely sure how much and how to classify my expenses/interest, etc.... time to do some investigating...

<blockquote class="lyrics">"I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough (no, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love" - Eddie Money</blockquote>
