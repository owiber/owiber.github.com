<br />I went ahead and played around with the demo version of <a href="http://www.hdrsoft.com">Photomatix</a> since they've got a universal binary now and promptly broke down and bought it.  The above image was generated with one RAW image processed multiple times with different exposure compensations.  I think it looks pretty neat.  For comparison's sake, the original is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/180297713/">here</a>.<br />
I also did <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/180171244/">another one</a> with Andrew and Van that's pretty cool too (that was my first attempt).  I tried it on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/170148748/">that one bridge picture</a> that I thought would work well HDR, but I actually didn't like the result that much.  Maybe I'll play around with it more...
