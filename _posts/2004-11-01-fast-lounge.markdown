Van and I signed up for FAST lounge at Liquid (the group that helps setup in the morning), so we had to wake up at 7AM.  It was highly unpleasant, especially since we went to sleep at around 4AM... haha.  When Van and I got to UTC, no one was there, so we proceded to call Tim names because he told us to arrive promptly at 8AM.

Then, after lunch, I took a nice 4+ hour nap. Yummmmy.
