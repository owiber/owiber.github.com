Don't get me wrong, I sorta liked the other animated gif of Olivia... despite it looking nothing like her, but... gotta make it better =)  this is the better one =) <br /><center><br />(heh... accidentally overwrote it, will fix when I get home)<br /></center><br />Not that bad... if you've known me long, (4 years)  you know I used to waste my life making stuff like this, this one is one of those I made back then (I think... heh, I made a lot... I think I made this one, I know I made one like it if not this one, theres a lot of them out there)<br /><br />But obviously, since I made it a long time ago, it was not done with Olivia in mind, it looks *sorta* like her, but not really, I cant picture her in this outfit... but... well, it's better then the one I worked on today and last night, and its the closest I ever did =)  <br /><br />-Minix
