Okay, rapid fire on the weekend:
<ul>
<li>BV TS dinner boat party on Friday</li>
<li>I returned to ultimate on Saturday - I stubbed my toe a bit and I'm really sore now because I've been out of it for a while... but it's good to be back. =)</li>
<li>Watched the USA vs UK game</li>
<li>Quick trip to IKEA</li>
<li>Watched <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em> with Melissa</li>
</ul>

I have also discovered why Home Depot is in the top five US retailers... man, I've been there so much in the past few days as I've been working on my room (almost done... pics later this week)!
