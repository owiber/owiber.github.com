I think I pretty much just played a lot of DotA this weekend.  That, and ultimate which was pretty tiring as we had a low number of people (means more running).  It was pretty fun though.

I purchased Halo: Reach but have not played it yet...

The past week or so the traffic on 360 has been terrible!  I hear it's because some side streets are still closed. =(  At least there's hope that it will get better... I thought someone just messed with the light timings to mess everyone up.
