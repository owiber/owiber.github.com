The adventures of the evil bunny... continued!

> <img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/cs.jpg" width="100" height="130" border="1" align="right" alt="Counter-Strike">Somehow, HellHare ended up in Round Rock, Texas. <i>"Vhat en da heehaw havveppend? Ow vid Isa ind up en dis pase?"</i> wondered HellHare. It was there where he got mesmerized by the many computers at a local LAN party... where two of the young people (called Van and Oliver) were killing everyone else in Counter-Strike. Because of this, HellHare's small biography somehow skipped a day. <i>"Isa veleave dat dursduday wud lozz en u tem vubble ur sumding..."</i> explains HellHare.

CONTINUE HELLHARE'S ADVENTURE ON SATURDAY!<br /><br />Would also like to point out that Minix <i>did</i> do well the first/only Half-Life game we played... but Van and I kicked butt in Counter-Strike. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
