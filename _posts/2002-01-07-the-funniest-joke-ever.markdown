It's because I'm nice, that I'm granting you all the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/daily/20/jokes.htm">"Scientifically "proven" funniest joke of all time"</a><br /><br /><i><center>"Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson go camping, and pitch their tent under the stars. During the night, Holmes wakes his companion and says: 'Watson, look up at the stars, and tell me what you deduce.'<br /><br />Watson says: 'I see millions of stars, and even if a few of those have planets, it's quite likely there are some planets like Earth, and if there are a few planets like Earth out there, there might also be life.'<br /><br />Holmes replies: 'Watson, you idiot. Somebody stole our tent'."</center></i><br /><br />personally... I don't agree, but ahwell =)<br /><br /><br />-Minix
