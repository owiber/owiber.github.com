I guess I should post something before January is gone!

First, I got Oriana a puppy. He had a cool name at the humane society, Thor, but she changed it to Badger.

This guy also got Mozilla sick, but he's getting over it now. He's also very fat, and looks like he's always sad. He seems like a pretty fun puppy though. Here are a few more photos of the little punk:

In other news, I am taking a six week sabbatical from Bazaarvoice and helping out the crew at <a href="http://www.greatergoodlabs.com/">Greater Good Labs</a>. It's bittersweet as the team I'm leaving is super great, but I'm looking forward to helping start something new. Super kudos to BV for giving me the opportunity to take some time away.

It's been about a month and a week and I'm still sitting at about half a tank of gas. Given this, I think even when I do need to fill up, I'm not going to fill up all the way. Pretty pleased with the Volt so far. I did the calculation and during the winter, it's probably around 65 cents to charge up all the way. In the summer, it'll probably be around $1.

With that, I will leave you with this:
