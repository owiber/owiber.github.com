Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. =)

We had a family over today, the Tangs, that we've had over every Thanksgiving for many many years now and the son in the family, Justin, is in his third year at UT I believe.  Back when he graduated high school, my mom gave me a card and $50 to give to him and despite having seen him multiple times (sometimes even with the card on me), I kept on forgetting and he never got it.  Eventually, I lost it in the Legacy apartment somewhere, but I found it when we moved out and today he finally got his high school graduation card.  Haha... well, better late than never, eh? =)

I flip the switch, we're going home
transistor's right on time
resistors fall in line
capacitors are at full
all engines good, no breach of hull
with all the hope that I could beg or borrow
I can't wait, can't wait for tomorrow" - Brave Saint Saturn</blockquote>
