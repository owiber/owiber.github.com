I've apparently been awake for the past almost two hours and I can't go back to sleep (which is a rarity for me).  I suppose I might as well blog!

Here are some pics from Sunday, when Al ran his first marathon!

Ryan had an "accident:"

Yay, London Lad!

Here's my sign, which I don't think Al liked that much:

I'm sure he liked Meagan's more:

For the rest of Sunday, I cleaned up a good chunk of my house which was long overdue for vacuuming, then took a nap in my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/4155627909/in/set-72157622734265683/">tauntaun</a>.  Went to dinner with Sam, then chilled for a while with him and Ryan before going to sleep again only to wake up two hours ago... and here I am.

I spent way too long trying to find lyrics to put here... but alas, they have been found!

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Life is like a hurricane here in Duckburg
Race cars, lasers, aeroplanes - it's a duck blur
You might solve a mystery or rewrite history

Duck Tales, Oo-oo
Tales of derring-do, bad and good luck tales, oo-oo

D-d-d-danger, watch behind you - there's a stranger out to find you
What to do? Just grab onto some Duck Tales, oo-oo!
Not pony tails or cotton tails but Duck Tales, oo-oo!" - Mark Mueller/Disney</blockquote>

Did you know that Mark Mueller wrote the Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers theme song as well?  That guy is awesome.  Okay, time to try to sleep again...
