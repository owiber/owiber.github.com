Isa vilz hup ta Niw Yerk Cita!!"</i> So off HellHare went, to the Big Apple...<br /><br />There, HellHare had to sneak past customs... he decided to disguise himself as a stuffed animal. It worked, except customs thought he was so ugly, they chunked him in a trash can. <i>"Oh velz, ut lezt Ima inz da U-esa-A..."</i> HellHare then found the local 7-11 and stole a map. Unfortunately, maps don't have the location of nuclear silos on them. <i>"Dohz, tupeed mupz"</i> muttered HellHare.<br /><br />So off HellHare went <i>again</i> to find the silos the hard way...

<br /><br />WILL HELLHARE EVER FIND THE NUCLEAR SILOS?!<br /><br />WHAT REALLY DID HAPPEN TO THE CHICKEN!?<br /><br />THESE ANSWERS AND MORE, NEXT TIME!<br /><br />-Oliver
