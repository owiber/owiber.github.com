Today we went to some beach four hours away and woke up really early to do so.  Was quite a bit of fun, but I think all of us (except for Andrew) got burnt.  I did, however, put a small amount of sunscreen on myself (or rather, other people put it on me) to make a heart on my chest, a smiley on my right arm and "MOM" on my left arm.  The heart didn't turn out so well, I think, but Van <i>might</i> have a decent picture.

I'm going to be uploading pics to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber">flickr</a> as I sleep, I'll title them later... heh... Edit: Ok, never mind, I titled them already. =)  And here's a pic just for our favorite Brit:

We finished the night off watching True Lies at Jen's again... wheeeee!

And, this song is a throat killer:

<i>"If I should stay,
I would only be in your way.
So I'll go
But I know
I'll think of you every step of the way.

And I will always love you
Will always love you."</i> - Whitney Houston

That song always reminds me of Kevin Costner...
