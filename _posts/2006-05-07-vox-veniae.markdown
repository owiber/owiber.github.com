<br />We launched the <a href="http://www.voxveniae.com">Vox Veniae blog</a> today which should be documenting the steps of our new church plant.  Looking forward to it. =)  Bookmark it and keep up with it. =)<br />
In other news, congratulations to ViraJ and his Toshiba offer... he'll be leaving us for Houston, but at least it's not Iowa or something like that. =)<br />
Tomorrow, it's dunk time!  Congrats to Megan, Nancy, and Van! =)
