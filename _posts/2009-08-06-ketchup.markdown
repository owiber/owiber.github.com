Why is it that ketchup packages are so small, particularly relative to, say, mayonnaise ones?  How often to people actually use <em>one</em> package?  I just don't understand...

Now that I've complained about ketchup, I have realized I don't have anything else to talk about, which makes this blog post <em>just a bit pointless</em>.  Enjoy.
