My family's always filled the garage with... things not cars, so my new house was pretty much the first time that I've actually used a garage for my car.  I drove from my apartment to the house in pretty heavy rain today and man... having a garage is awesome.

In other news, I also got my sectional in today.  Yay!  Lost at my place tomorrow?

"Oh mama I'm in fear for my life
From the long arm of the law
Lawman has put an end to my running
And I'm so far from my home
Oh mama I can hear you a crying
You're so scared and all alone
Hangman is coming down from the gallows
And I don't have very long" -Styx
