Haha, so I dug through archives of OliverWEB and found some bits that actually made me laugh out loud:

<blockquote>
aoushi: think destiny
aoushi: lol
Owiber: aha!
Owiber: someday
aoushi: she'll be coming around the mountain when she comes...
Owiber: my wife will be the defender of the universe
aoushi: Whoa, I won't go that far
Owiber: like Voltron
aoushi: ugh, you destroyed my romantic thoughts
aoushi: I'm going to bed
</blockquote>

Ah, Viraj:

<blockquote>
Viraj: no donuts for her fatness
Oliver: ok
Viraj: no, i was asking?
Viraj: retard
Oliver: QUESTIONS END WITH QUESTION MARKS, RETARD
