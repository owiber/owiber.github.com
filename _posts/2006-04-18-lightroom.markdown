<br />I've recently switched over to shooting in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format">RAW</a> vs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEG</a> which I think even Mark would endorse despite his general disapproval of my photography habits. =) Coupled with this switch, I've started to test out <a href="http://labs.macromedia.com/technologies/lightroom/">Adobe Lightroom</a> which is pretty spiffy despite a few issues (mostly because it's still beta).  There're some performance and quality issues here and there, but it's pretty nice to use for me most of the time.  There's a problem with exporting the color profile correctly on Intel Macs, but Aaron posted a nice <a href="http://glayvinz.net/2006/04/15/intel-lightroom-workaround">workaround</a>, so that's all good.  I think beta2 expires in June or July, so we can probably expect beta3 within the next month or two.  Looking forward to it.<br />
As for Sam's bday, we went to Siena on 360, which was more expensive than I think most of us liked... but that's ok, Sam, we'll just bring you to McDonald's next year. =)  I didn't have my flash that night, so not many of my pics turned out all that great, but you can see some of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bamboovanpoo/sets/72057594110205638/">Van's</a>.  I think Aaron took some too, but they're not online as of yet.
