<a href=http://www.dumblaws.com target="_blank">Dumb Laws</a>. Hehe, site's really funny... here's a little snippet:<blockquote><i>In the state of Texas:<br />It is illegal for one to shoot a buffalo from the second story of a hotel. <br />It is illegal to milk another person's cow. <br />A recently passed anticrime law requires criminals to give their victims 24 hours notice, either orally or in writing, and to explain the nature of the crime to be committed. <br />The entire Encyclopedia Britannica is banned in Texas because it contains a formula for making beer at home.</i></blockquote>Funny funny... also pretty funny is <a href=http://www.dumbcriminalacts.com target="_blank">Dumb Criminal Acts</a>.<br /><br />-Oliver
