Sam and I just had a massive "breakfast" at 7:30AM in the morning.  Why the quotes around breakfast?  7:30AM isn't an unusual time for breakfast, right? Well, we stayed up all night and will probably go to bed within a few hours, so it was more like a dinner for us than breakfast.  Man was it good though.  We both had ~1lb. steaks. Mmmmm...

I have a pic of Sam's meal, but I'm too lazy to upload it right now.  Maybe later.

Pie in oven...
