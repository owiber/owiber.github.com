So, I've gotten more used to the CMD+W/CMD+Q thing.  Here's my experience with the browsers:<br /><br /><b><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a></b>

> <b>Good:</b> Nice integration with OS (ie. FTP links open in Finder, allowing easy download of folders, multiple files, etc.). <br /><b>Bad:</b> Slow w/Gmail.</blockquote><br /><b><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/camino/">Camino</a></b><blockquote><b>Good:</b> I like the way the tabs look. Haha.<br /><b>Bad:</b> Nothing that really stands out... seems to load slightly slower than Safari.</blockquote><br /><b><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a></b><blockquote><b>Good:</b> Extensions rock. =) Just good 'ole Firefox.<br /><b>Bad:</b> CMD+M is b0rk3d, it loads Mail instead of minimizing.

<br />For now, I've been using Camino... but I have all three in my dock and I change pretty frequently. =)<br /><br />Some of OS X's "just works" stuff is kinda nice.  It's nice that they give you (for the most part) nice defaults that most people would want... however, it freakin' ticks me off when you can't change those defaults.  For example, when you plug in an external monitor, it automatically extends the desktop.  Okay, that's good. I like that.  However, what happens when I don't want to use the laptop LCD and I <i>just</i> want the PB to use the external monitor (with the laptop LCD open to use keyboard, touchpad)?... that's right, I can't do it (without some hacking, at least). So anyways, the best I can do for now is to mirror the display, but then I'm stuck at 1024x768 on the external monitor. Ugh.<br /><br />Anyone know how to set your own profile in iChat? Yeah, I can't figure that one out yet.<br /><br />My CPU temps hit 66.8C today while compiling KDE.  I flipped the PB on its side now (bottom of PB is perpendicular to table)... it cooled down to <65C... heh.<br /><br />I had a big experience of inadequacy when it came to free "native" (as in, not using gFTP or something through X11) FTP clients for OS X.  So much so, that I started to look into writing my own.  I found that UT gave us Fetch for "free" (w/Bevoware) though, so I've played around with that and it seems like it would do the job.  Perhaps I'll write my own eventually anyways though, might be a nice little project to undertake. <br /><br />Hmmm... oh, I LOVE <a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net">Synergy</a>.<br /><br />-Oliver
