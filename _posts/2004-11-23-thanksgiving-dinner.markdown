Sam and I went to our Element's Thanksgiving potluck at Jen's house.  It was uber good, especially Chris who honored us with a whole turkey. Yay!

The rain was a bit unpleasant as I got the lower part of my pants pretty wet on the way from UTC to Union. Aiaaiaiaiaiaiaaiaaaa... I don't know what else to say. Goodbye.

Oh wait, I know what I was going to talk about.  I just finished Half-Life 2.  The ending (plot-wise) is a bit disappointing (just like the original), but man... gameplay was pretty hot at the end (at least I thought so =).  I last saved pretty close to the ending, so I think I just played 30 minutes tops until I beat it... that was a bit sad.  The game as a whole seems pretty short, especially when compared to the first.  Oh well... it's Metroid Prime 2 time. =)
