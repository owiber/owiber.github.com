Lala, and now, something from the Bible... (sorry for the language... other bible in car... and this ones kind of old)<br /><br />OK, oldest guy in the bible... was Methuselah who lived to 969 years old... how do you think he died?  I would guess... Old age... but...<br /><br />Genesis 5:26  "And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty and nine years: and he died"<br /><br />his son, Lemach was born when Methuselah was 187<br /><br />Genesis 5:25 "And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech"<br /><br />and then, Lemach had a son, Noah<br /><br />Genesis 5:28-29 "And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son, (29) and he called his name Noah.<br /><br />Genesis 7:6 "And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth"<br /><br />lala... 187+182+600 = 969... which means that Methuselah either died the year of the flood, or in the flood... <br /><br />Pretty cool I thought =)<br /><br /><br />-Minix
