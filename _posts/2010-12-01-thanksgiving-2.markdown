Yay long weekend!  Thanksgiving was pretty good. There was an absence of the <a href="http://www.livizilla.com/">loud one</a>, but Oriana did try to <a href="http://twitter.com/owiber/status/8386342765461504">kill me</a> with a bottle.  I went to Mark's on Thanksgiving as my family (strangely) decided to have dinner on Friday instead of Thursday.  On Saturday, during ultimate, Viraj decided to flash the elementary school with his jungle of love.  Watch for him on the sex offender registry soon!

I watched Unstoppable with Sam which was enjoyable.  Did I also watch HP7 this break?  I think I did... I thought it was meh.  I found it akin to an amateur school play with no heart.  Not sure if was poor acting, but I just didn't get a good sense of atmosphere... it just felt kind of hollow and a collection of scenes rather than a movie that invoked much emotion.  Maybe would have been better had I read the books.

On a completely unrelated topic, is anyone else amused with how terrible pandas are at living?  Sometimes I think it would be funny if there were a crazy stealth group out there that strived to accomplish what nature probably would have done without our meddling - make pandas extinct... by assassinating them.  Plus, it would probably really piss of China.
