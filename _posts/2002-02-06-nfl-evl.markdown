AHHHH! I am posting on Oliverweb... be afraid...  <br />I am trying to update the NFL webpage without ever actually speaking to Mrs. Owen<br />It is part of a policy that includes "for the rest of my life."<br />Anyways, if you are in said speech squad... for starters do not relay my dislike for said coach... second of all, please email me... bshelley@austin.rr.com... or tell Oliver to email me... anything that has happened as far as victories are concerned or any upcomining tournaments.<br />I know I am asking a lot... Sorry... but your help will be greatly appreciated.  <br />Oh and hello everyone!<br /><br />-Brook
