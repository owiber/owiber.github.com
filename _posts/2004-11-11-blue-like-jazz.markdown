So I gave into <a href="http://www.liquid-acc.com/mt/archives/2004/09/book_review_blu.php">Gid's plug</a> and started reading <i>Blue Like Jazz</i> by Donald Miller.  Sam bought the book off <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0785263705/qid=1100165035/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-6680825-4278452?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://product.ebay.com/Blue-Like-Jazz_W0QQsopmsZ58640Q3a2Q3a1055Q3a1185668673Q3a46883653Q3a51c8e324a8720375f8e602b845710eaaQ3a1Q3a1Q3a1Q3a1153681296">eBay</a> or something like that, so I figured... "what's there to lose?" and picked it up.

It's been a long time since I've read a book, especially one not required by a <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/features/archive/2002/tolkien.html">class</a> I'm taking, much less one about Christianity.  I must say though, this book is pretty good.  A lot of things Miller talks about are very real... it's like I could have written some of those pages myself from personal experience (well, if I were a writer =).

I love some of the analogies he makes too... like how his belief in Jesus is like penguin sex... you'll have to read the book to figure that one out though. ;)

Anyways, I'm going to plug this book too.  When I'm finished, you guys should give it a shot.
