This is the year the world's supposed to end, right? =p

In usual planeteers fashion (we have a mailing list called planeteers, so that's the name "the group" has inherited), we rang in the new year by playing Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield and at midnight we mass suicided by shooting each other and throwing frag grenades at our feet. Good times. Back in the day, we used to play Raven Shield a lot of the max difficulty which is <em>really</em> hard and you almost always die in one hit from "the terrorists." Whenever only a few of us were left and we weren't near completing the map, someone would yell "all hope is lost!" which would usually prompt some/all of the remaining players to turn on each other and then suicide themselves so a new round would start. Sometimes, though, "all hope is lost!" would be called prematurely by someone who just didn't want to wait around that long for the next round... you'd immediately hear "NO NO NO!" but it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy as we don't need a lot of reason to kill each other. =p

Here are some instagram photos of Mozilla from my phone. I need to try to take more "real" photos of him while he's still a puppy...

On the way back from Arkansas:

Mozilla snuggled up against my leg and passed out:

Also, I decided to get a new car (Accord Coupe V6):

2011 was kind of an off year for blogging for me. I'll try to pick it back up this year. That's my resolution.

ALL HOPE IS LOST!
