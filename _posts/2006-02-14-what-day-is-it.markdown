While other people are all being romantic and/or bitter, I'm just going to sit here and say my <strike>MacBook Pro</strike> Intel PowerBook got upgraded before it even shipped...

VONDERFUL! ABSOLUTELY VONDERFUL!

On another note, I have been playing Guitar Hero on hard recently, and let me tell you... it's hard.  After listening to the Top Gun Theme a few times, Mark and I have taken it upon ourselves to create a game that allows us to play it with the Guitar Hero guitar.  To not allow the Top Gun Theme to be played with the toy guitar with magical colored buttons would be a crime against humanity and everything 80's.  Not sure what time-frame we're looking at for completion, but the PlayStation2 to USB converter I got from Fry's seems to not be working, so that's our roadblock at the time being.

In the mean time, I'll be playing with the boys... =)
