Hilo ^.^ I thought this was pretty funny.. I found it a little bit ago.. it's a story I wrote in 6th grade (I never finished it, thank goodness).. it's not that long (TG.. ;))... but it's really funny because... can anybody imagine Oliver or me like this? =D<br />***<br /><br />In a far away galaxy, lived a young, beautiful princess. Her name was Oriana Wong. Her mother and father, the Queen and King, lived in the palace with her and ruled the country. Oriana wasn't alone though, true, she is the youngest of her family, but she had an older brother and sister named, Prince Oliver and the #1 princess Olivia. Here is the story of their lives.<br /><br /><i>For more, go to Comments ^.^</i><br /><br /><br />-Olivia
