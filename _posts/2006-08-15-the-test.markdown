After running earlier today (well, technically yesterday I suppose), I realized that I can't give "the car test" to a girl I take on a date.  The car test is when you unlock the passenger door of your car to let the girl in, then see if she leans over to unlock the driver's side.  Apparently Jen passed the car test when Andrew gave it to her (good job! haha).  Anyways, so I take just my car key with me when I run and I realized that there is no key hole on any of the doors except for the driver's side.  So my only options, if I were to administer the test, would be to use my remote to unlock all the doors, let her in, then lock the doors again, which is kinda clumsy... <i>or</i> I could buy a new car with a key hole on the passenger side as well as the driver's... hmm... ;)

while cradling his prize.
A flickering of yellow light,
within his mother's eyes.
She holds them to her heart,
keeping them where they'll be safe,
clasped within her very marrow,
dandelions in a vase."</i> - Five Iron Frenzy
