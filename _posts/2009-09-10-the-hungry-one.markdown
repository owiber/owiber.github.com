I forgot to post about this past weekend, so I will do so now, late.

On Saturday, I went up to Round Rock for lunch with the family (Olivia came to drop off the dogs before her trip to Asia).  Then,  I accompanied Nancy to Houston who picked up Viraj to go to a baby shower.  I opted to stay at Viraj's apartment with the thought of "oh, it'll only be two or three hours" (said Nancy).  They left at about 5something and I was under the impression it started at around 6ish, so come around 9:30ish, Viraj calls and tells me they're about to cut cake then they'll leave soon.  Okay, I think, I'm hungry, but not too bad, so I can wait a bit longer.  At almost 11:30, Viraj calls me again and says they'll be back in 15 minutes.  In like... 45 minutes after that, they rescue me from hunger.

I don't remember what I did on Sunday... I think I saw Extract which was meh.

On Monday, I went to Salt Lick with Ryan, Al, Eduardo, and Elyse.  That's the first time I actually did their all you can eat thing.  It took a long time for us to actually get food (like 1.5-2 hours), so I was hungry again. =(  But!  It was pretty good food.
