<br />In anticipation for tomorrow's beta release of CS3, I played around with a few pics in Photoshop again on my PC.  I've been too lazy to transfer pics from my mac to my PC to edit pics in Photoshop with... and also been too impatient to put up with Photoshop running via Rosetta.  Anyways, Oink, being the good looking dog he is, was a good subject, so I played with two of his pics.<br />
Man, I miss Photoshop.
