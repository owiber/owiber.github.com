Well, I don't really know what to talk about, but I think <a href="http://store.valvesoftware.com/productshowcase/productshowcase_HL2HeadCrabPlush.html">this</a> is pretty awesome.

I'll be accepting a final placement offer from a group at Freescale soon (hopefully =), and then they'll be sending me to a training event in Toronto next month.  I'm looking forward to it.  Anyone been before, got any tips for "must see" things?  I'm not sure how much free time I'll have though, so we'll see.

Oh yeah, so my old Moto cell phone's vibrate died on me, so I switched back to my T610 (better phone anyways =).  However, the address book transfer seems to only have worked partially, as I'm missing some entries I used to have.  I don't feel like looking to see who I'm missing, so if you run into me, make sure I have your number. =)
