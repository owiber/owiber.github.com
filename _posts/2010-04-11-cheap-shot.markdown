So here I was minding my own business casually throwing a frisbee around for ultimate warm up, when Sam goes ballistic and charges me yelling "I'M GOING TO SMASH YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE BETTER THAN ME!"  Luckily, he is slow and I managed to avoid him, but unfortunate for me, a rock or something on the ground was <em>too</em> slow and did not avoid me at all. I stepped on it in a rather poor fashion causing me to roll on my right foot.  So now I have a sprained ankle. =(  Thanks a lot, Sam... and you too, rock.

There shall be retribution.
