Poor OliverWEB has been neglected again.  People still need to send me stuff for <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/friends2004>Friends 2004</a>. =) <br /><br />Apartment is a blast, I'm (kinda) cooking! I think Chinese is going to be the most brutal class of this semester for me, but hopefully not too brutal. =)  My EE prof is insanely boring, but I think I can live with it.<br /><br />Uh oh, gotta take off for Game Dev. Seeya kiddos. ;)<br /><br />-Oliver
