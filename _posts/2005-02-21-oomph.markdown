Why is it that my EE classes are always so boring? Ugh.

Uh oh... looks like Andrew may be getting revenge on me for the psychology deal... hehe, I had it coming I suppose. =)

I hunger... food... shall be obtained soon!

In other news, Andrew and Mark join the ranks of the Alliance on Illidan.  For Gnomeregon! ... and Stormwind I suppose.

Yes, I'm still alive.  Got two tests this week though... should be alright hopefully.

We all ended up over sleeping on Sunday and none of us made it to Liquid =/.  It's nice that they record the talks for us to listen to, I'll have to go grab them.  I dreamt my mom scolded me for not going to Liquid while I overslept... which is interesting.  On the bright side, Mommy, you don't have to scold me cause I had you do it to me already. =)
