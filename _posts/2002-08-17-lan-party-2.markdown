We're at the LAN party, here's what Andrew has to say:<blockquote><i>Well I'm here destroying Ochs at pretty much everything.  He's horrible at all these computer games, especially counter strike.  Sean and I are teaching him "TOTAL DOMINATION."  Oliver is a little girl who can't play counterstrike worth anything.  Scooter and Oliver wasted their money on the g-boxes because it doesn't cover up their shabby skills.  Maybe skills isn't the right word, perhaps flaws.  They are gonna be knifed all night long.  To quote a wise old sage: "Can you smell what the Rock is cooking."  To quote a stupid young sage (Oliver): "I'm a little, frail girly woman who can't play counterstrike worth a crap." </i></blockquote>They're just jealous. =)Here's Van (Scooter):<blockquote><i>I shall kill you all.</i></blockquote><br /><br />-Oliver
