Well, it was pretty unfortunate that McCoy had to sit out basically the entire game.  Horns did a heck of a job staying in it though with a freshman QB.  I feel like Texas made plays happen but just couldn't overcome having such an inexperienced QB (which, IMO, played as well as we could have expected given the circumstances)... and pretty much gave Alabama the majority of their points due to mistakes.  What can ya do.  They were able to capitalize on the mistakes when Texas couldn't with our 2nd string QB.  Congrats, Alabama.  Texas special teams did some pretty nice stuff too.

On the plus side, with Gilbert playing like he did, seems like he could do much better with more training/experience.  Too bad Shipley won't be around next year.

Hook 'em!
