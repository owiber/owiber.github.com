Well, been keeping up to date with the news in our world at work and game up with these. <blockquote><i>Los Angeles, CA - Teen pop sensation Britney Spears whose hits "Oops I Did It Again" and "Baby, One More Time" is recovering today in a Los Angeles hospital after her breasts exploded while filming her latest video.   Three other people were treated for minor injuries.</blockquote></i>Hmmm... yeah... read the <a href=http://bbspot.com/News/2000/5/britney_oops.html target="_blank">rest</a>.  <br />It also seems like that Microsoft trial has made an unexpected turn...<blockquote><i>Redmond, WA - Microsoft today filed papers in Federal District Court alleging that the United States Government is a monopoly.  The papers allege that the current government has stifled competition, and has prevented innovation in government, by using its monopoly power to pass laws prohibiting the formation of another Federal government.</blockquote></i>Uh... that was very surprising, eh? Make sure you get the rest of the <a href=http://bbspot.com/News/2000/5/govt_mono.html target="_blank">scoop</a>, and while you're at it check out my source's <a href=http://bbspot.com/News/2000/5/govt_mono.html target="_blank">copyright info</a>.<br /><br />-Oliver
