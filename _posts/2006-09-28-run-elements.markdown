I ran three miles around Town Lake today despite my shin not feeling entirely alright yet.  I think it went okay, but I'll probably take it easy tomorrow.  We'll see.  I took it a bit slower and did nine minute miles, but I think I'm definitely going to be ready for the Hairy Man 5k in October.  Whheee, I'm really looking forward to waking up early, grabbing some Round Rock donuts then running that 3.1 miles. =)

My first Elements meeting was today and I think it went pretty well.  I'm glad Sarah decided to co-lead with me (thanks, Sarah! - I don't know if you'll ever see that, haha).  She brought almond jello for us all to eat and apparently loves to feed people (this is not the sole reason I am glad she decided to co-lead with me, but is a definite plus, haha).  We played a game called Mad Gab and Mafia, both of which I hadn't played before.  Mafia kinda reminds me of BANG!  Mad Gab is pretty fun. =)  It seems like the people in my group are pretty open and not too shy, so I'm hoping discussions will be lively.  Looking forward to it next week, thanks everyone who came. =)

Sam's mohawk is awesome.

Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

In and out my life (in and out my life)
You come and you go (you come and you go)
Leaving just your picture behind.... (ooh)
And I've kissed it a thousand times (ooh)
When you snap your finger, or wink you eye,
I come a-running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings,
And there's nothing that I can do

I can't help myself,
No, I can't help myself" - The Temptations</blockquote>
