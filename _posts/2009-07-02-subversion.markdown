I finally got around to setting up a personal subversion repository on my <a href="http://www.slicehost.com">Slicehost</a> box.  I've been meaning to do that for a while, but never got around to it.  I'm currently in the process of checking in 600MBish of files from OliverWEB... I'm not entirely sure what takes up all that much space, but I guess I've accumulated a decent chunk of stuff over the 10ish years I've had it around. =)  I <em>really</em> wish I still had a copy of my old Geocities account.

I'm going with coworkers to the <a href="http://videogameslive.com/index.php?story=217">Video Games Live & Blizzard Live</a> concerts in Houston on the 18th.  Anyone else want to come?  To prepare for it, Tiff has convinced me to host a Diablo II (I've never played) LAN party at my place on the 11th.  Should be fun! =)

I can't make another post without putting up a photo to make use of my flickr code, so here're some old ones:

Oh, and these are dedicated to my lovely littlest sister who will love me even more after this...

Oh yeah, and on a work related note, it's cool to see <a href="http://www.bazaarvoice.com">Bazaarvoice</a> mentioned in articles alongside <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, and/or other much hyped sites:

</ul>

... there also seems to be a trend developing with people getting creative trying to get hired at BV:
