Oye, nights of DotA leave my head a little funny feeling.  Haha... was fun, guys. =)  It is rare that we get full 5v5 games (that aren't on Battle.net with strangers)... it was pretty cool.  We had Andrew and Jen connect from Florida and play too.  Hope we weren't too mean to you, Jen. =)

I was listening to my Andrew Approved iPod as we played DotA and it was quite amusing battling it out listening to Celine Dion and the like.  Haha... your heart will not go on!!
