So it's been determined that Apple is going to have tight control of applications that will run on the iPhone and third-party applications will not be supported, or at best, extremely limited to ones Apple "contracts" out.  That's pretty disappointing to me as even though OS X is pretty cool on its own, productivity is increased a lot by third-party applications (Quicksilver, for example) and I could see that happening on the iPhone too.  One of the cool things about smartphones is that they support other applications and they have a community of developers that let you customize your phone to suit your needs.

And this B.S. about Cingular not wanting applications to run rampant on their networks is pretty stupid when many many many other smartphones are capable of running third-party software.  Sounds to me like Apple just wants to shift some of the blame to Cingular.

That being said, the iPhone is still one snazzy piece of gadgetry.
