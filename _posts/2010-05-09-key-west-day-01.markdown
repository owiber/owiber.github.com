I'm not going to blog much, but here are a bunch of photos!  I tried to make more of an effort to take photos of myself this time around as I've noticed I've had a severe lack of those... =)

I'll post more tomorrow!  I have a lot of video as well, but I'm going to wait until I get home to get through that.  The rest of the photos from day 0+1 are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157623896916263/">here</a>.  I also started a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157624021286088/">Pink Stuff</a> set! (Thanks, Melissa, for the idea =)).

Kat took this photo while we were on the beach.  It's awesome... so I'm going to use it as the thumbnail for this post.
