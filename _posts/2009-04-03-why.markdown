... hello there, Internets!

I decided to do something for April Fool's at work yesterday and spawned a ticket related to <a href="http://bazaarvoice.com/productOverview.html">our products</a> (I'm leaving the attached image referenced in the ticket out, sorry =):

The ticket then got passed around to various parties including some directors and a VP.  Here are some of the memorable ones:

This reaffirmed the notion that I'm working at the right company. =)

I don’t have the time
Babies, get in line
I’ve got a protractor
Got a stapler now
it goes Ka-ching!
gotta have the math club crown me king
gotta rock the screen with the cosine graphing
on my calculator
If you’re up
and if you want a piece of me
wave goodbye and blow a kiss
Cause you can’t handle this” - Five Iron Frenzy</blockquote>
