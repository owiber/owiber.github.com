Having a public blog is problematic sometimes.  Things happen that sometimes are a bit too touchy or weird to talk about publicly (or maybe it just makes too big of a deal out of something small by being so public?) so even if I have something to write about, I don't because... yeah.  Haha.  Sometimes I make private blog entries, but that seems kinda scary sometimes.  It's like writing a private letter and hiding it under a rock in the playground... what if something happens and someone finds it? =p

Maybe that's why people used to keep diaries (or for the more "manly," <i>journals</i>)... of course, what if someone stole that?... Hmmm, maybe I should be like Bale in The Prestige and write everything with a cipher... ;)

Ebonics iz almost like uh cipher. I wonder how it iz going ta translate dis here sentence! don't make me shank ya!
