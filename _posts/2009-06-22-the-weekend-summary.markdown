Ochs and Sam thought I made a commitment to post what I did every weekend in <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/2009/05/18/the-weekend-in-summary/">this post</a>, but I don't think I did.  Regardless, I suppose it's a decent idea, so here it is:

<ul>
<li>Friday: Went to Home Depot with Nancy to look at tile for my house.  Needed to get a replacement light bulb and water-filter, but forgot to take note of which on both accounts.</li>
<li>Friday: Went to see Up by my lonesome.  Left feeling a little post-Amelie... like I wanted to hug someone, but less "romantic" like after Amelie.</li>
<li>Saturday: Got contract work at my house (tiling, knocking out a wall, etc.) estimated</li>
<li>Saturday: Peter moved out, so I vacuumed the room after he left... I then went to clean up some other parts of the house since I was already in the mode.</li>
<li>Saturday: Watched season one of Weeds with Chad and Nancy after bumming around listening to music at my place, getting not very satisfactory burgers at Fuddruckers and a now almost customary weekend double iced alamocha at Texpresso.</li>
<li>Sunday: Went to Lowes and picked up the light bulb and water filter I needed.  Took a quick glance at tile.</li>
<li>Sunday: Went home and got a hair cut (thanks, Mom!).  My doggy Orbit is getting old. =(</li>
<li>Sunday: Hung out with Ochs & Sam at Burnet Sonic for a while at night.</li>
</ul>

No pictures this week, though.  Adios!

I wanna hold em' like they do in Texas plays,
Fold em' let em' hit me, raise it, baby stay with me, (I love it)
Luck and intuition play the cards with spades to start,
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart - Lady GaGa</blockquote>
