Our family typically celebrates Christmas more on Christmas Eve than on actual Christmas day, so that's what happened again this year.  I picked up iLife '11 and took it home and Olivia toyed with it a bit and quickly came up with this using its new trailer "mode:"

Here are a few shots of the Wong family opening presents, and related shenanigans:

Then, at around 1AM on Christmas day, Steph and I repeated our early morning IHOP run with Sam, Heather and Viraj this time (last year OMan and Mikey were there).  We ended up staying there until 6:30AM.  Craaazy.

We also didn't let Christmas get in the way of our usual ultimate game, so we rounded up a group of six and headed to the field with the wind blowing and the temperature in the 40's.  We ended up revising the rules so that the frisbee was still live if it was rolling which caused quite a bit of hilarity.  We played until until a team scored five and got out of there.  Heather invited me over to Jimmy's for dinner and they (plus Steph) cooked dinner which I was able to mooch off of... woo!

Now it's time for me to play with iMovie... adios. =)
