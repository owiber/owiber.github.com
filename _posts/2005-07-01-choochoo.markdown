This week has been lunch week.  Started off the week meeting with Sam and Van on campus and chilling with them during lunch, then Nancy and I had lunch today at Chili's.  Been a while since just the two of us have gotten to talk for an extended period of time so that was fun. =) I start work after next week, so the lunches will be coming to a halt soon. =(

Also today, Brook and I received our ceiling fan. Wooooootness!!!
