Dang, blog. Sorry it's been so long. =)

I was holding off on mentioning this because there was so much I wanted to talk about, but I'll just go ahead and throw it out there and if there's anything else for me to say, I'll do it another time. =p After about 6.5 years at Bazaarvoice, I'm off to <a href="http://www.massrelevance.com">Mass Relevance</a> starting July 1. BV's been such a great experience filled with lots of opportunity for me that it's bittersweet to say goodbye. The team I've been on for the past year-ish has been awesome and I'd be lucky to experience that type of passion, camaraderie, and teamwork in the future. I'll miss you guys!

That said, it's time I start a new adventure, so I'm headed to MR where I'll have the benefit of working with a lot of ex-BVers who I think highly of. If they switch to first.last email addresses before I get there I'll be very sad! ;)

I added more to my nerd XP by going to a Magic draft with Jonney on Wednesday. Despite drafting what I thought was the worst deck I've ever drafted, I got second place with it, so that's good I guess. I've always thought that Magic was a game I could be really competitively good at if I wanted to invest the time into it and "go pro" despite how silly that sounds (hey, some of the <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=protour/default/prizes">prizes</a> are no joke though). =) That said, I don't know if I can handle playing it for days straight.
