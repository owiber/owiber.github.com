So I'm too lazy to write up the password protected post right now... not all that much to say anyways (yet) so maybe I'll just write a huge summary later... haha.

Anyways, we had our first discussion-focused Elements yesterday and I think it went really well.  I was scared of having a group where generating discussion is like pulling teeth and I would have to fight silence trying to get people to talk, but that's definitely not the case.  I think we could have gone on for a few more hours with no problem if we didn't cap the discussions off at some time, haha.  Makes my job a lot easier. ;) Thanks to everyone who came and shared your thoughts, and Kathy for the cupcakes.

Afterwards, I apparently made a stupid bet with Kathy that she couldn't tie my hands together if I didn't want her to and ended up being physically injured.  I'll show you a picture of the massive bruise on my hand and leave it at that... I think it actually looks worse in person.. haha.

I went to Angell's Xanga earlier this morning and decided to listen to his radio blog... hehe, gives me some more variety than the stuff that's on my iPod I listen to all the time.

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Yesterday was over
Today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you'd be
That face is tearing holes in me again,
but today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all the things you put me through
I'm holding on by letting go of you" - All-American Rejects</blockquote>

Haha... so... angsty.
