Merry Christmas all! =) I've put up the few pics from Grace's house (Christmas Eve plus a few from last day at Chad's dorm) <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/college/christmaseve">here</a>. <br /><br />Also, after looking at <a href="http://www.mercury-x.net/xmas" target="_blank">Ochs' present</a>, I remembered what <i><b>I</b></i> usually do during Christmas time that I totally forgot due to... um... I guess having a car and hanging out more outside of my house. =) Well... I suppose OliverWEB won't be having it's annual eChristmas Card this year. =( Or maybe I'll do one, it'll just be late... really late probably... maybe even after New Years' late... heh... I do have the time. =)<br /><br />Well, you can look at <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/christmas/">1999</a>'s and <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/christmas/2000/">2000</a>'s again for the time being. =) Have fun, and again... Merry Christmas! =)<br /><br />-Oliver
