So what I had thought was the fault of the lens at the end of <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/2009/06/06/xkcd/">this post</a> was actually more the body from my very rough testing of shooting 5D MkII vs 50D in my backyard.  The 5D2 just has a lot better contrast and color vibrance straight from the camera, which I would guess is attributed to its larger full-frame sensor.

This is a bit disappointing to me as now I'm less inclined to bring my 50D around, but it's still a pretty good backup body and I can still use it for its reach.  Oh wellllll....
