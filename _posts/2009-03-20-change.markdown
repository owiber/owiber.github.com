I created a <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/races/tauren.html">tauren</a> hunter the other day and I named him Cowbama.  Once I hit level 7, I stopped by Thunderbluff and some level 63 death knight started trying to make fun of me.  He kept on whispering me with "hey, can you do this?!" and ran across the Thunderbluff pond.  Despite not being able to walk on water like death knights, I replied "YES, WE CAN!"

I didn't get a reply after that, so I'm not sure if the death knight was just confused or if he got the joke...

And forever it will be you and me
Ooh your life is sun,
Chasing all the rain away,
When you come around you bring a brighter day" - Atlantic Starr</blockquote>
