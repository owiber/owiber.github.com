Now this post is for Andrew!  Andrew finally unveiled his <a href="http://grove.ufl.edu/~drewser/www">new blog</a>, which was rather unexciting, expecially compared to his previous blog's <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/javajoseph.png">unveiling</a>.  So, now you can find links to Andrew's blog on the sidebar. =)

I think there was something I was going to blog about, but I can't remember... dreams? No... hmmm...  well, maybe I'll remember later.

In other news, waking up feels like breaking through a concrete wall again. =(  Man, it was nice being able to wake up easily... I even got a good amount of sleep last night.... hmph.
