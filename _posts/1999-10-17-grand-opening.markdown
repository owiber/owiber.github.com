Welcome to the GRAND OPENING of OliverWEB! =) Not everything is up yet (and I assure you, there will be tons more stuff). Today, I'll be getting some pictures from HEB... I'll scan them in tonight maybe. Right now, the <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/wwwboard/index.shtml">message board</a>, <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/guestbook/index.shtml">guestbook</a>, and <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/boredom2/index.html">Boredom2</a> (including <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/boredom2/quotes/index.shtml">Quotes</a>) pages are up. Make sure you check them all out ;) Have fun!<p>Oh, and there will be tons of inside jokes on this site... so if something seems weird, strange, or whatever (like the "Anon is funny" part in the <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/index.shtml">intro</a>) it's probably an inside joke. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
