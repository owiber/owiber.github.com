I just wanted to say that the weather is awesome. =)  Nice days remind me of dandelions.

<blockquote class="lyrics">"In a field of yellow flowers,
underneath the sun,
bluest eyes that spark with lightning,
boy with shoes undone.
He is young, so full of hope,
reveling in tiny dreams,
filling up his arms with flowers,
right for giving any queen.

Running to her beaming bright,
while cradling his prize.
A flickering of yellow light,
within his mother's eyes.
She holds them to her heart,
keeping them where they'll be safe,
clasped within her very marrow,
dandelions in a vase. " - Five Iron Frenzy</blockquote>

Edit:  My last post of <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/2005/02/24/chicken/">this variety</a> seemed to be popular, so I'm gonna try to give it another go.  I don't expect to top it, haha.  The topic today is dandelions. =)

OMan doesn't really blog I think, but if he did, this is what he'd say about dandelions:
