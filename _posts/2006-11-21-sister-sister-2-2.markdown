Happy birthday, mui mui. =)

First day at the new job went well I believe.  Still ramping up on a lot of things and it's a little slow due to Thanksgiving, but I think it will work out well and be pretty exciting.  Mmmm, I might write more later.  Tata. =)

<blockquote class="lyrics">"January 1, I've got a lot of this on my mind
I'm looking at my body through a new spy satellite
Try to lift a finger, but I don't think I can make the call
So tell me if I move, 'cause I don't feel anything at all

So Carry Me,
I'm just a dead man
Lying on the carpet
Can't find a heartbeat
Make me breathe,
I want to be a new man
Tired of the old one
Out with the old plan" - Jars of Clay</blockquote>
