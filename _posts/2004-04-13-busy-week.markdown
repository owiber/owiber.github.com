Argh, this week is going to be pretty yucky starting tomorrow.  I've got an EE test on Wednesday and an Online Game Tech program due on Thurs (might use one late day on that though to make it Fri)... argh, then I gotta work with my Chinese partner to write our skit show. Uber yucky.<br /><br />I'm kinda anxious for this semester to end now... it started off alright, but it seems like all my classes converge every once in a while to make a really hectic week, and those tire me out -- I just want to finish and move on to the next semester.  A new set of topics and teachers, please. =)<br /><br />Also pretty excited about getting the apartment next year, should be lots of fun, can't wait until moving in day. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
