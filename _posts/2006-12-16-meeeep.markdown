Yay! Today at work, I entered the office and our office manager greeted me with a brown box and said "this is for you."  I thought it was an LCD at first, but nope, it was my MacBook.  Yay!  So I spent most of the day setting it up and it's running smoothly now.  Yipeee... time to be more productive. =)

I had a larger, inferior spec'ed, HP laptop that I didn't even bother taking home (I just left it locked at the desk)... but this MacBook is nice enough for me to carry around with me.  I still think I prefer the MacBook Pro's keyboard though, but it's nice nonetheless.

Rumor has it a 12" MacBook Pro might be released soon... I might be tempted... the only reason why I'd stick with the larger version is better photo editting though... so I dunno, we'll see.
