I think I have a bad case of allergies or a mild cold. =(  I think Rita blew something bad over to Austin from the boonies or something cause it started on Friday...

Van made me tea yesterday though and put lots of honey in it. Awwwww, how sweet. lol =)

I'll be at the Freescale booth tomorrow at Frank Erwin for the UT Career Fair Expo thingymabobber.  Good luck to all attending. =)
