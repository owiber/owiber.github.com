Oh yeah, so yesterday after Vox Veniae, we went on over to Denny's.  Sam, Jake and I ordered our drinks and I asked for hot chocolate and the waitress says "we're out of hot chocolate."  So, shocked as I was that Denny's ran out of hot chocolate (they should have an infinite supply, right?!), I ordered the flavored cappuccino instead (which wasn't bad, but I really felt like hot chocolate!)

A bit later, Van, Mike and Kathy showed up.  At this point, we now have a waiter because the waitress' shift was over.  Kathy orders hot chocolate and he goes "ok."  Sure enough, he goes back to the kitchen and out comes some hot chocolate for Kathy.

Hmph.  I think that lady hated me or something.
