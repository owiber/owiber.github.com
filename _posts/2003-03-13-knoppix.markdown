So I stumbled upon Knoppix again (I think Van tried them out a little a while back). And while I was chatting with Mark, he discovered this neat little tib-bit of info from <a href=http://www.knoppix.net>Knoppix.net</a>:<blockquote><i>Knoppix 3.2 has now KDE 3.1 and "persistant home" - a way to save the configuration also on hd and USB-Memory-Sticks.</i></blockquote>So, I had this idea... you get one of <a href=http://www.meritline.com/minidvdr.html>these</a>, and one of <a href="http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProduct.asp?submit=manufactory&catalog=68&manufactory=1785&DEPA=1">these</a>, and you've got a really really awesome mobile custom OS in your pocket(s). Oh man, I'm not sure how, when or if I'll actually use it but the prospect of actually doing it is so cool I'm so very tempted........<br /><br />-Oliver
