Well, I hope I'm allowed to talk about this (I'm thinking yes, since it's public)... Freescale's been <a href="http://news.moneycentral.msn.com/ticker/article.asp?Feed=BW&Date=20060915&ID=6026985&Symbol=US:FSL">bought out</a> it seems and is buying all shares for $40.  That's crazy!

Ah, hindsight is 20/20.  I should have kept all of my ESPP stocks.  Well, I still own some and will be making over $2k from this, but if I had kept it all... awww... man... over $5k.  *sigh*

feel the crush she will incite
the spark of hope she will ignite

Softer than the lightest snows
watch her as the moment slows
in my face the door will close
and there she goes." - Five Iron Frenzy</blockquote>
