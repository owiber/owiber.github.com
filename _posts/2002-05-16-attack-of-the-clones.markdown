Ok...well.. I just saw the first showing of the movie in Austin, well technically it was the 3rd, 12:03AM, anyways, IT ROCKED! I don't care what the reviews said. The graphics were tight, the story was tight, and the character development really helped make 4,5, and 6 more real. Anyways, I am going to see this one again! Just thought ya'll should know that it is worth spending the money on. The only bad news was NO MATRIX II PREVIEW! =( But oh well, watching Yoda kick some butt was fun! Catch ya'll later, I have work in less than 6 hours now! =)<br /><br />-Ochs
