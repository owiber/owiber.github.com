I went home today and ran around the neighborhood.  My left shin is really killing me for some reason... maybe I did something to it yesterday when I had to suddenly stop for a dog that got in my path.  Poo.  It hurts. =(  Tomorrow, I think I may try to hit up McNeil's track and calibrate my Nike+ thingy-ma-bobber.

Both Oriana and my dad are sick... I hope I don't catch anything...

<blockquote class="lyrics">Oh, my love, my darling,
I've hungered for your touch a long,
lonely time. Time goes by so slowly
and time can do so much.
Are you still mine?

I need your love.
I need your love.
God speed your love to me." - Righteous Brothers</blockquote>
