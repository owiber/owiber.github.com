Back when we moved into The Legacy, we came up with a constitution that really didn't do much good because no one really followed it.  There were lots of "good" rules in there and ones that I probably shouldn't quote here... haha.  One of the better ones though, was this gem:

<blockquote><pre>9.  GUESTS
   a.  Sam’s hands shall not be guests to Sam’s pants.</pre></blockquote>

Haha... good times.
