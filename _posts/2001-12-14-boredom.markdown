Well, i am in a state of utmost boredom, which, unfortunately for you all results in a futile attempt to inflict that which i am experiencing upon each and every one of you who now comprises the STUPID audience.  The only thing between me and a downward acceleration of negative 9.8 meters per second per second is my dear hippocampus...  You other fools, however, SHOULD attain that downward acceleration, by simply propelling yourself from the top of the UT clock-tower.  Have fun...<br /><br />-Chad
