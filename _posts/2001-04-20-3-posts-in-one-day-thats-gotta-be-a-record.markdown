Ladida... I'm depressed... wanna know why?<br /><br />Cause I don't have a job...<br /><br />Oliver has a job... Motorola...<br />Chad has a job... Albertsons...<br /><br />other people have jobs... me?  no work... I could go back to gallup...<br /><br />Oh!  and speaking of people with jobs!  Ochs just got an email from IBM, he got a job there!  11/hr I think!  Woohoo!  Think he can get me a job there?  Congratulations Ochs!<br /><br />And... if anyone has suggestions for a place I could work... umm... comment, I need a job...<br /><br />-Minix
