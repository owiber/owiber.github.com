Played some Rosetta Warcraft 3 on the MBP today.  Seems like the issues were primarily due to the custom map we were trying to play (not sure if it's a problem specifically with the map or with the Rosetta/Mac/IntelMac and the map together).  We played a short regular game and a game of DoTA and it seems to play okay.  The mouse acceleration is still a bit weird to me... I hear there's a Microsoft utility I can use to make it Windows-like... I was using a Logitech mouse though so not sure if that'll work... I might try it out sometime.

In other news, with casual use (web surfing, iTunes) the MBP doesn't get scorching hot like when it's importing 11000+ photos.  Parts of it, especially towards the rear can still get pretty warm though.
