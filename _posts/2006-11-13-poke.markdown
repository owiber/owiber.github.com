Well, I'm feeling a bit better... just have an annoying lingering cough, but no headache like last week.  Robbie Seay led worship at Vox Veniae yesterday, and I was supposed to take pictures, but I forgot my 5D + 85 f/1.2 at the apartment, so I ended up borrowing Kathy's XT with my 85 f/1.8.  I think she ended up taking more pics with it than me, but I haven't gone through them yet... it is definitely really strange to go from the 5D to the Rebel XT because everything is so much smaller on the XT... it's so <i>cute</i>. ;)  Haha, j/k.

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Hold me, blow all the pride from my bones,
With your fire.
Hold me, breathe on this heart made of stone,
Keep it pure.
Hold me, saviour of heaven and earth,
King forever.
Hold me, love of my life lead me on,
Through the fire, lead me on... " - Delirious?</blockquote>
