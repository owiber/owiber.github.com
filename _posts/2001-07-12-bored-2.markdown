Yeah, I'm bored again... went to AOL to see if the screenname "Owiber" was taken... it wasn't, to my surprise...<br /><br />So now I have the "Owiber" screenname to add to my large collection of screennames... I'm thinking about switching over to it from "WabbaMan"... what you think? I just like change I suppose, and "Owiber" sounds goofy, so seems like a decent candidate. =)<br /><br />I'm even gettin tired of OliverWEB's layout a little... couple more months and I might change it again, I think I'm going to go back to black background... or at least a dark color...<br /><br />Alright, back to "work" now. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
