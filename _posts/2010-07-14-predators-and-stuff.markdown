We started last weekend by getting an early start on our ICC raid in WoW.  We made it to Putricide, failed a few times and stopped.  On Monday, we one shotted that punk though (then successfully did Blood Prince Council and Valithria).  Woo!

Saturday, we ultimated it up and spent an hour talking about zombies at Sonic.  I got bored later that night and watched the tail end of Scary Movie (not a bright idea...).

Sunday was Vox, World Cup and Predators (acceptably entertaining).  After eating some food at the Drafthouse, I was still hungry, so I yanked a bunch of people to Jim's and ate more.  Then I was <em>really full</em>.
