Meatcation has begun!  We kicked off the week with some tasty lamb chops with asparagus.  We also built a questionable structure to guard our flame against the water from the heavens.

As usual, Flickr has more <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157622734265683/">Meatcation pics</a>.

I also somehow managed to watch Star Trek three times last week (four if you count once with the commentary).  Although, to be fair, I did fall asleep half of the last time through it (food coma).  Here are some photos of my crazy sisters from Thanksgiving:

We plan on starting the smoker at ~3AM to cook brisket for Monday night.  On to day 2!
