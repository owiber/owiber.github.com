Hellooooo there intarweb! Long time no talk, eh? =)  I have dropped to nine hours this semester so hopefully it will be an easy last one for me.  Elements meeting last Monday was pretty nice and it looks like we're going to have great discussion this time around.  Unfortunately, it looks like all the girls have ditched us and our group is now the "guys-only" Elements.  Hmmmm...

World of Warcraft status: level 47
Real life status: still single

lol ;)
