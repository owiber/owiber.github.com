On Sunday, Sam and I went with Ochs to <a href="http://voxveniae.com/">Vox</a> where we've both been long absent from.  He put it well in his Facebook post when he said it felt like home.  It was good to go again. =)

Ate lunch at Sunflower, went home and half-napped, half-chatted with BV crew (Ryan, Steph, Heather) and Sam until the Saints/Vikings game.  Watched the game, then headed to Pluckers to meet up with Al and Scotty.

That about sums up Sunday.  Time to finish off January!

Come around and talk it over
So many things that I wanna say
You know I like my girls a little bit older

I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight" - The Outfield</blockquote>
