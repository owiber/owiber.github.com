Here's the new layout... few things to fix...<br /><br />Gonna have the left sidebar scroll down, so it doesn't seem like the site just dies after a page down...<br /><br />And... you probably need <a href=http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash>Flash 5.0</a> for the left sidebar to work right... eh... yeah... alright... adios. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
