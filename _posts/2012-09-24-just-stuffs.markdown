So here's a video montage of my vacation. Probably filled with inside jokes and immature humor. I don't expect anyone to watch or enjoy the whole thing, but here it is. =)

I'm getting some estimates done on some major renovations to my house. Haven't decided if that's the route I'm going to take, but it's exciting to think about! I've been looking at a bunch of pictures on Houzz.com, which is pretty cool, though they have so many photos, it's overwhelming sometimes.

I started watching West Wing and I'm well into the third season now. It's been pretty enjoyable and some of the episodes have been surprisingly emotional (that is, triggered a strong emotional response from me).

I also had a crazy dream last night where I went to NYC/Vegas (it seemed to randomly change in my dream), and went to some hotel room with a girl. Somewhere in there I really had to take a crap, so I went into the bathroom and found an extremely complicated toilet. After that was done, it became apparent that this girl was supposed to kill me based on orders from some drug lord. Fortunately, she decided that she wouldn't kill me and smuggled me out of the city instead. I woke up worrying about the safety of this girl since she just disobeyed some powerful bad guy, but that quickly faded into a chuckle as I realized I was dreaming.

That's all you get for now. Tata!
