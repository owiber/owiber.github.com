This weekend, Blythe and Ryan had their Zelda playing party at my place where they beat the first one.  We also watched some Firefly, ate some Indian food, and I watched some 21 (which wasn't very good, but I watched it anyways).  After that, other people showed up at my place and hung out til the wee hours of the night.

Not much else happened other than that... pretty uneventful weekend, I suppose.  On to a probably hectic week! Woo!
