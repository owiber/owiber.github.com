Yes, day four of Meatcation.  Today is the day of the elemental bacon.  Bacon = bacon of the earth, scallops = bacon of the sea, and duck = bacon of the sky.

The day started with preparing the duck for smoking:

After it was cleaned, we started on a whole black drum fish for lunch, which we baked in a cast of kosher salt.
