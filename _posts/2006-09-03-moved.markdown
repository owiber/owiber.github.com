Yay!  Uhhh... too lazy to find lyrics for this post.  Will continue later. =)

There will probably be some things broken... please excuse them for the time being... I'll have them fixed shortly, hopefully.

Edit: Oh fine, here're some lyrics.

<blockquote class="lyrics">"I've got sunshine,
On a cloudy day.
When it's cold outside,
I've got the month of may.
I guess you'd say,
What can make me feel this way?" - Temptations</blockquote>
