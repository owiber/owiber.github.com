Gah, so I rebooted the Mac Mini to give OS X another go.  After googling a whole ton, the only way I can figure out how to get multiple remote desktop sessions up and running is this <a href="http://www.redstonesoftware.com/multidesktop.html">ugly thing</a> which requires all the users you want to allow VNC sessions for to ALWAYS be logged in, plus you have to specify different ports for each one... yuck.  If anyone knows a better solutions, let me know.  For the time being, I'll stick with Ubuntu Linux.

Update: Uh oh, lol, I attempted to upgrade Ubuntu to the latest version and didn't quite follow the instructions correctly so now some things are kinda ugly.  Bah, I guess I'll reinstall tonight...  Mark, if you'll be using it, YMMV. =)
