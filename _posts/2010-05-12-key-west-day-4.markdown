We got back to Austin on day four of our Key West trip, cutting it a bit close to our JetBlue flight.  It was my first time flying with them and I was pretty pleased.  We managed to find $10 ($21 after all the associated fees) flights back to Austin direct from Ft. Lauderdale, so we did that and cancelled our Continental flights.  $21 is worth going direct and not having a long layover in Houston.  We got back nearly six hours earlier than we would've, so that was cool.

I think these two photos are from day three, but oh well.  I didn't take any on day four.

Here are some chickens that lived around our house:

And here's Nathan's sunburn from wearing his cap:

Peace out, yos!
