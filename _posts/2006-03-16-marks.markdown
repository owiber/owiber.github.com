<br />Been a while since we've hung out at Mark's... good memories there, and we added more tonight.  Of note were the Trivial Pursuit champions, Andrew, Mark, Van and myself (and my Kevin Mitnick answer... yay animated GIFs!).  Also, masked in an attempt to play the above pictured game with her, I very triumphantly slapped Kathy in the face much to my satisfaction. =)  Sorry, little one, it's just so much fun. =p
