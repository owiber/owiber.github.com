Figured I should keep up the blogging streak even though I don't really say all that much, but if it wastes a few seconds of your time, my job is complete. =)  I'm just sitting here at work twiddling my thumbs waiting for IT to come setup my new laptop, which is a very frustrating process. Ugh ugh ugh.

Actually, the main reason why I wanted to make this blog post is so I could throw up the lyrics at the end of it.  But you'll have to wait for the end to see that... did you just cheat?  Cheater.  I think I'm going to start throwing short lyric excerpts at the end of my posts cause they're fun (and make people call me a fruit bag, which is fun too - being called a fruit bag, that is... not actually being one... uhhh...).

There are a lot of things I want to buy, but I need to stop my spending in hopes of actually saving money for a house or something like that.  A few things... <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod nano</a> (gotta wait for the next upgrade though)... then if I got the iPod nano, I'll probably get sucked into getting a <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/gear.html">Nike+</a> eventually.  I want a <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19&amp;sku=320-4335">Dell 24"</a> too... and have been slightly itching to upgrade my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a>, if only for the gigabit ethernet... haha.  Anyways, I'm holding off pretty well on all of that right now, cause there's no way I'm getting all of it.  One thing I will definitely be getting though is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/">Adobe Photoshop CS3</a> when it's out and a universal binary.  Mmmmm...
