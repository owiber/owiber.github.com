Well October just kind of flew by and we're nearing the end of November and my blog is severely neglected. Maybe next year I'll try to do my once a week blog post thing again. I kept up with that fairly well back in, uh... <a href="https://www.owiber.com/2011/?order=ASC">2011</a>?

I've successfully moved into the new house and sold the old one. Yays! Antoinette was on the market for less than 24 hours and I got multiple bids and took one that was significantly over the asking price. It was sweet. So far I'm enjoying Mueller pretty well too. There's a decent amount of construction going on around me, but once that's done I expect it to be a lot better. It's really awesome having an HEB super nearby. Also in a year or so, the <a href="http://www.aldrichstreet.com/">town center area</a> will be getting populated and that's just two blocks-ish away.

Tomorrow, the family flies out to San Francisco to be with Olivia for Thanksgiving. It'll be the first Wong Thanksgiving in SF since a very long time ago! TIME TO PUT YUMMIES IN MY TUMMY.

I will now leave you with a photo of Andrew and I from when I visited Dallas last month or something. People were taking pictures in front of this thing, so we joined the bandwagon. /shrug
