Friday was a good day.  Started the day with our quarterly Bazaarvoice All-Hands at the Alamo Drafthouse (South Lamar, which we will soon have to move from because we've filled it up).  Congratulations to all my team members who won awards!  Here are some photos!

Then, we had our holiday party early (so we could celebrate with our international teams who flew in this week) at the Driskill.

They had scallops, which I consider to be the bacon of the sea!

Then, some of us closed the evening by chilling at Jim's for a while.

Ah... in the words of Steve Balmer...
