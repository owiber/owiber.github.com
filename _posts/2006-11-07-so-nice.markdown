It's so nice outside, I really want to go running. =)

Speaking of which, I think my shin is finally doing better... I <i>think</i>...

Did I mention that I don't like this whole time change and that it gets darker earlier now?  It's not cool for my running habit. =/

Around work, there are a WHOLE TON of butterflies everywhere... what's with that?  I was driving around and kept on smacking into them and hearing small "thunks" on my windshield.  There are <i>a lot</i>.
