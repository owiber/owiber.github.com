So I uploaded some pics from the Elements potluck/white elephant thing.  Yeah, I seem to be getting sick more frequently this year than usual... dunno what's up with that.  Although, it's not so bad what I've got... just a cough/throat thing mainly... maybe I caught something from Stephanie >=|... haha, j/k. =)
