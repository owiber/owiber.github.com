On Friday, the Technical Services and Design Services teams went to SeaWorld. Woo! It was my first time there... here are some photos:

I also finally uploaded some photos I took of Oriana's dorm room.  She's got this thing for Edward, apparently... it's a little creepy.

On Saturday, we played the usual ultimate game... I don't think anyone was seriously injured this time.  I watched Equilibrium which I recently purchased on blu-ray with Mark and Ryan, then hung out at Chad and Nancy's for a long long time.

I think Sunday was fairly mellow... as was Monday where we had the usual WoW night with some DotA splashed in. We finally beat Sindragosa!  That cursed dragon... Greg cooked for us and it was tasty.

Oh yes, and on sister-site, <a href="http://samitic.us/">Samiticus, the Sam Ni fan site</a>, apparently <a href="http://samitic.us/2010/09/sam-pooping/">Viraj has struck again!</a>
