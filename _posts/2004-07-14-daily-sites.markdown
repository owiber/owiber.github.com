Here are the sites I visit multiple times daily:<br /><br /><a href=http://www.slashdot.org>Slashdot</a> - I'm obligated.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.osnews.com>OSNews</a> - OS's interest me... we'll see how I do in the class.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.gizmodo.com>Gizmodo</a> - Happened upon this from reading a <a href=http://www.wired.com>Wired</a> article.  It's pretty cool, got lots of nifty gadgets.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.gmail.com>Gmail</a> - What can I say? I forwarded all my email to my Gmail account, now it really stinks when it goes down (thankfully, never for long... at least not that I've experienced).<br /><br /><a href=http://www.xanga.com/pancy>Nancy's Xanga</a> - I basically use Nancy's Xanga as a bookmark of everyone's Xanga.  So if Nancy ever kills her Subscriptions list or you're not on her subscription list, too bad. =)<br /><br />Sites that I visit multiple times weekly:<br /><br /><a href=http://www.penny-arcade.com>Penny Arcade</a> - They're only updated a few times weekly, so I only go on update days.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.hardocp.com>[H]ard|OCP</a> - I used to go here multiple times a day, but I've slowly grown out of the modding and hardware frenzy I used to have and have become more interested in software (thus OSNews being one of my favs).  Anyways, I still go here and to <a href=http://www.hardforum>[H]ard|Forum</a> a few times a week, just not daily.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.tech-report.com>The Tech Report</a> - TR's got some cool stuff occasionally... so I visit occasionally.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.kde-look.org>KDE-Look.org</a> - I'm still looking for a good KDE window decoration that isn't just a blatant rip of Aqua.  I've seen a screenshot I've really liked, but the punk either just made it in Photoshop or is too selfish to release it. =)<br /><br /><a href=http://www.mrbrook.com>MrBrook.com</a> - Umm... yeah, Mr.English-Major, you need to update your blog more.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.liquid-acc.com>Liquid</a>/<a href=http://www.liquid-acc.com/forums>Liquid Forum</a> - Yeah... I go here every so often (mostly for forum) but it's been kinda quiet lately.<br /><br />On another note, whoopwhoopwhoopwhoopwhoopwhoopwhoopwhoop!<br /><br />-Oliver
