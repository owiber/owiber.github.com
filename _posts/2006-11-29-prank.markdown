I went to lunch with a coworker and he was mentioning pranks he had done or had done to him in Jester.  Once, he was taking a hot shower and his roommate dumped flour on him.  It turned into dough and he had chunks stuck in his hair for days, haha.  That's a pretty good one. =)

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Rain, rain on my face
It hasn't stopped raining for days
My world is a flood
Slowly I become one with the mud

But if I can't swim after forty days
And my mind is crushed by the thrashing waves
Lift me up so high that I cannot fall
Lift me up
Lift me up - when I'm falling
Lift me up - I'm weak and I'm dying
Lift me up - I need you to hold me
Lift me up - keep me from drowning again" - Jars of Clay</blockquote>
