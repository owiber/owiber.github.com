Was on campus today and met up with Sam and Kathy who were shooting some pics of some TiSA girls.  Took some pics myself (not many of the girls they were shooting cause it was weird having so many cameras on them and I didn't want to make them feel awkward) and I think they turned out alright.  See <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157594316172560/">flickr set</a>.

Umm, that's all I'm gonna say for now, might post some more later, haha...
