I was talking to Melissa about when I read the Lord of the Rings series which was back at UT when I took Linguistics of Tolkien's Middle Earth with Mark.  That brought up the subject of our awesome project where Mark and I took a <a href="http://www.mrtechhappy.com/ling-eng/index.php?day=030505">MrTechHappy plot</a> and translated it into Quenya, Tolkien's elvish language.  The translated comic is available <a href="http://www.mrtechhappy.com/ling/index.php?day=030505">here</a>, but I would recommend just reading the <a href="http://www.mrtechhappy.com/ling-eng/index.php?day=030505">English version</a> then looking at our <a href="http://www.mrtechhappy.com/ling/notes/notes.pdf">translation PDF</a> which is pretty awesome.  I like how we translated my name to mean "SnowFlower."

There are quite a few good translations, I thought, but here are two humorous ones as a preview:

Haha...
