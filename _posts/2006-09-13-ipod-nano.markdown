Well, apparently the "available today" means you can order today but that the Apple stores don't actually have them.  Oh wells.  I will be ordering my iPod nano online now... so now I need to decide if I want to put an engraving on it and if so, what.  I have two lines with 23 characters each.  Ideas?  Mark and Brook suggested:

<blockquote class="lyrics">"You've got the touch,
you've got the power!!!</blockquote>

But I'm not sure if I really want that...
