On September 24th, 2001, the site of OliverWEB was suddenly and deliberately attacked and defaced by the evil forces of the Empire of Minix.<br /><br />It will be recorded that the many images changed by the Minix Empire makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time, the Mind of Minix had deliberately sought to deceive OliverWEB by false statements and expressions of kindness and humor.<br /><br />The attack yesterday on OliverWEB causes sever ugliness and l4m3n3ss to OliverWEB layout and design. Very many effects were lost. In addition, other images on OliverWEB and FTP password have been reported as being lost and/or destroyed.<br /><br />Yesterday, Minix was also declared l4m3.<br /><br />Last night, Minix slept happily despite his evil doings.<br /><br />Minix Empire has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout OliverWEB and it's many pages. The facts of yesterday speak for themselves.<br /><br />As Ruler of OliverWEB, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense.<br /><br />I now declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Minix on Monday, 24 September, a state of war has existed between OliverWEB and Minix Empire.<br /><br />Now... I want my site back or you will die, punk.<br /><br /><br />-Oliver
