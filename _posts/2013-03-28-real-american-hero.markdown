I saw the new GI JOE with Mark and Greg. It was fairly bad, but I guess enjoyable enough. My expectations were for an enjoyable bad movie and it probably met those expectations, but did not exceed. Maybe next time it can apply for a raise.

In a week, a few of us make a quick hop to Phoenix to stuff our faces with some more grub! About a month after that, I will be taking a vacation with the family to San Diego. It's been forever ago since we've taken a family trip, so this is almost like a first time, especially since we're all older now. I'm looking forward to it, but I think my eardrums are bracing themselves. :p

The site I was helping the <a href="http://www.greatergoodlabs.com">Greater Good Labs</a> guys with launched a little while ago, <a href="http://snapkind.com">SnapKind.com</a>. Check it, but be gentle... it's a baby and needs some growing up still. ;)
