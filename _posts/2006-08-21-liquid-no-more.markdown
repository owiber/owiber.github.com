Tonight was Liquid's last service.  I don't remember if I was at Liquid from the very beginning (I either showed up sometime during the first or second semesters it was around), but it was really cool to see Liquid grow and change and to be a part of it for the past few years (particularly the website, haha).  I remember making a multitude of video promos with Tim Yip, making Bubbleman Flash animations, working on Worship Without Words stuff, website grunt work, and many other things.  Good times. =)

Next Sunday (which I unfortunately will not be here for) will be the first Vox Veniae "preview service" at our new location.  Please pray for Vox Veniae and that it may show God's love to everyone it comes in contact with. =)
