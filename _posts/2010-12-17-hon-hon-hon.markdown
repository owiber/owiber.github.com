There was lots of <a href="http://www.heroesofnewerth.com">HoN</a> last week.  Somehow, Viraj has become really really <a href="http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/player_stats.php?aid=3216931">horrible</a> at the game.  We end up balancing teams counting him as a negative because he usually ends up hurting his team more than he helps.  That makes balancing a little tricky because on the rare occasion that he doesn't do horribly but instead just does mediocre, his team ends up winning because we've tried to balance out his horribleness.

On Sunday, my mom locked my car keys in my car, so I slept while she obtained my spare key.  Wooooooo.

I've been watching Veronica Mars and I just finished the first season.  Man, that would have been a frustrating season finale and they even tease you throughout the first episode of the second season before resolving the cliff-hangers.  Glad I don't have to wait. =)  Enjoyable show.
