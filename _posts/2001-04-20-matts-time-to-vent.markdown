I hope this doesn't annoy anyone, but no one is online, and I need to complain. =)<br /><br />First... I hate stereotypes... I hate how some people will label an entire group based on one person.  For example someone saying that all christians hate gays, and have no fun... I like to think I have fun, and I have never hated anyone... I dislike people who say that all "blacks/crackers/etc are stupid."  or any other generalization like that... it just annoys me...<br /><br />Second... I hate how people create these stereotypes... how there are some people who claim to be christians and then go out and kill people who are gay to "prove" it.  Or how people who are christians insist that other christians only listen to christian music, because all other music is from the devil...  UGH!  heh... ok, I think I'm done...<br /><br />Thank you for listening to me rant...<br /><br />-Minix
