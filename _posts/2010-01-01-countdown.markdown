Heather and Steph have kidnapped <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jryanfunsponge">my roommate</a> for the New Year festivities in Dallas, so I'm:

<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/wedX64L_j9E&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/wedX64L_j9E&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>

...again.  But!  That's not bad as I think a nice and easy countdown to the new year doesn't sound very terrible at all.  I'm itching to do something somewhat creative/productive though, so we'll see if I can muster up anything (don't hold your breath).

As a side note, in 2000, <a href="http://oliverweb.com/friends2000/">when asked</a> where I'd be ten years from then, I said:

<blockquote><em>I'll be 26... possibly married, making money... probably got a master's in Computer Engineering... leading a happy life. =) Hopefully. =)</em></blockquote>

<a href="http://oliverweb.com/friends2004/">In 2004</a>, I said in five years, I'd:

<blockquote><em>Stable job... somewhere... I wonder if I will have a girlfriend then... lol. Owner of an Infiniti G35 Coupe. =)</em></blockquote>

Apparently my future telling was not very keen back then... married? Hahaha... oh little Oliver, you slay me.

See ya in 2010!
