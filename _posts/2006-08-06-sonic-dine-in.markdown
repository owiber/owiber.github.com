Has anyone ever been to a dine-in Sonic?  I went to my first one today and it was... weird.  Haha...

I added an RSS feed of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/profile?user=owiber">YouTube videos</a> so you can view the latest shenanigans I catch on video.  Enjoy. =)

I started working on the new <a href="http://voxveniae.com/">Vox Veniae</a> site (linked site is a temp blog) on my desktop and had a strong urge to have multiple displays, so I took out my MacBook Pro, setup <a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/">Synergy</a>, and was off working on the new site with the ability to test with Firefox, IE, and Safari all with one keyboard/mouse!  Yay!  I had Photoshop running on the desktop cutting up the site design given to me by Karen, and smb mounted that directory on the MacBook Pro with two terminal sessions running vim open for the HTML page and the stylesheet.  It was an enjoyable development session... ideas are churning in my head for OWeb '07. =)  The only thing is that missing the "windows key" on this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Model_M_Keyboard">IBM Model M</a> keyboard (which is otherwise awesome) is sometimes problematic... haha.  Speaking of which, if anyone is looking for birthday gift ideas for me... <a href="http://pckeyboards.stores.yahoo.net/customizer.html">*cough*</a> ;) ;)

<b>Edit:</b>: Aaron asked me how I was recording the videos, and I just realized that I never really blogged about one of my latest purchases.  I recently bought a <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/casioz750/">Casio Exilim EX-Z750</a> almost exclusively based on its video-recording qualities.  The photo quality is supposedly decent, but I honestly haven't really tested it much.  The really nice thing about it is that it encodes into MPEG4 instead of Motion JPEG, which results in 3x or 4x file size reductions... so instead of maxing out at around 10 minutes on a 1GB card, I can get over 30 minutes on the highest quality, which is nice.  It records in VGA at 30fps... and looks significantly better than what you see on YouTube because they reencode it down to QVGA I think.  I've been meaning to test if they reencode if I actually upload a video at their desired resolution (and thus have higher quality than what they do), but I haven't gotten around to it yet.  There are newer versions out of this Casio (like the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/casioz850/">Z850</a>), which I think has improved photo-taking qualities, but Casio apparently gimped out the MPEG4 encoder settings and thus the quality isn't as good as the one I got.

After I copy the MPEG4's to my MacBook Pro, I use <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">mencoder</a> (well, with <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/major4/">ffmpegX</a> as the frontend) to reencode the MPEG4s into H.264, giving me another 3x to 4x file size reduction.  It's nice. =)
