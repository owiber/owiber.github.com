Well, I've been bored today, I had something I was supposed to do, but I couldn't concentrate on it... but, I was able to do a few random things.  I'm not going to bore you all with the details, if you're curious, ask =)  but, I have been drawing today, and... after awhile, decided the drawings I've done would make a really stupid comic!  I don't have a title, doubt it'll be around long enough to need a title, but, here are all three comics!  Why am I putting up the first two, when there are links below?
