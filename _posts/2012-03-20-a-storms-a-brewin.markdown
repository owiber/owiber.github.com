Whenever I write a blog post while it's raining, it reminds me of Sam. You can ask him about that sometime. While you're at it, you can also ask him about the time he watched me as I slept in our Jester dorm and imagined what it would be like if I were a girl and we were watching the sun rise together. I never asked him how that story ended in his head, but I'm pretty sure it's not pretty.

Speaking of sleep, here's one of Mozilla sleeping next to my modem:

A few days ago, Mozilla ran out the front door for the first time (I blame Mark). Greg and I chased after him and despite the worry in me that he'd get run over by a car, I was fairly amused by how elated he looked. He ran across the street a few times and went as far as two houses down, but he came back and started sniffing a bush for long enough for me to sneak up on him and grab his leg. After learning how fun it was to run free, he snuck out again later as Greg was leaving, but Greg managed to corral him back into the house. Shiba inus are infamous for not having good recall and while he's not bad when he's in the backyard (I've been positively reinforcing him by giving him treats after calling him back), that doesn't work at all when he's out front, so I'm going to have to take more care with making sure he doesn't sneak out.

if it brings You praise,
Take this beaten soul,
shivering hands I will raise.

Hope Unstoppable,
Sing the morning sun,
Wake up oh sleeper,
the Daylight has come.
