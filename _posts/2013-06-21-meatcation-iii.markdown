I've got two weeks off until I start at <a href="http://www.massrelevance.com">Mass Relevance</a>, and it just so happened that Andrew is in Austin for the first of those weeks, so it seemed like a good time to have Meatcation III! Here are some highlights with the rest being <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157634238556091/">here</a>. <a href="http://meatcation.com">Meatcation.com</a> will get you to past Meatcations. =)

On Sunday, we had sliders:

On Monday, we made some crazy cryoseared duck:

On Tuesday, we made (way too much) pot au feu with veal shank, beef shank, garlic sausage, beef bone marrows, and an assortment of spices, veggies, and potatoes. This is a picture of one pot. We amateurily bought enough to fill three (a pot next to this one as well as a large crock pot, elsewhere). I've been having this for lunch the past few days...
