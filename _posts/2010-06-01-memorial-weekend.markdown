I started my weekend early by taking Friday off and going to Six Flags over Texas with some peeps.  That was about what I would expect from a day at the amusement park (generally amusing, but tiring and it leaves you feeling gross).

Saturday, I went to Oriana's graduation:

Before dinner, I picked up Melissa and we made our way to <a href="http://twitter.com/owiber/status/14998175929">Hot Topic</a> as I prep for my next <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/4179842469/">self portrait</a>.  I don't have anything to show for it yet, but I considered the trip successful. =)

Dinner was at Perla's:

...after that, we scrolled South Congress a bit and there was cupcake eating:

Melissa made this face impersonating me... it's awesome:

Sunday wasn't too eventful... I attended Oriana's senior banquet for a bit then headed to Central Market to prepare for our Memorial Day feast, which I decided was a good opportunity to take another stab at <a href="http://www.owiber.com/2009/12/06/meatcation-day-7-the-finale/">a suckling pig</a>.

Monday was pig day.  We named this one Piglet. =)  IMO, I think it turned out better than the last time (or maybe I just had better cuts).  There's still a good deal left over, so if anyone wants some...
