Well, it's October.  I used to really like October (I guess I still do) probably because my birthday is in it and birthdays are really exciting as a child.  The birthday thing gets a bit less exciting the older you get I suppose, but there's still Halloween and... uh... Columbus Day I guess (oh, joy!). =)

Viraj bought me She's The Man... haha, thanks.  Although, unfortunately, I have already seen it... and I'm not going to watch it again unless I get more of you other people to suffer through it with me, haha.

I am accumulating a mass of pink stuff.  It's a little frightening... I think perhaps it has gone too far, but I don't foresee myself stopping anytime soon.  Trouble?...  Oh, I'll have a picture to back this up sometime within a few days.  Andrew'll have a field day too.

Edit: This is a test.  Xanga gave my oliverweb account a free premium trial thingy and I think it might have broken my crossposter...
