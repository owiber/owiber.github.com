Okay, this is a day late, but I'll try to remember what I did over the weekend... I've already forgotten what happened, but I remember Friday night ending at Jim's and my hands turned purple and I was shaking.  Something like that...

On Saturday, I woke up to <a href="http://www.livizilla.com">the loud one</a> calling me to tell me to make up for daughter inadequacies and to get my mom flowers, a card, and balloons.  I went ahead and did so after the customary ultimate frisbee game, but not before I popped a balloon, got the card envelope sucked into the checkout conveyer belt, and lost the "how to take care of these flowers" card that game with the orchids I got.  *shrug*  Happy birthday, mommy!

We had a decent amount of people show for ultimate including Van (woo!) and Victor.  Turned out to be a good 4v5 game.

On Sunday, my shins were feeling it pretty bad.  I think I gave myself shin splints the week before and I didn't really let off of them during this past weekend, so yeah... I'm gonna have to take it a bit easier next weekend.  Went over to Chancy's to watch the Cowboys lose (I don't really care about them, so no biggie for me =p), then went back to the park with some peeps to practice throwing the frisbee around.  Ended the day with some korean food and bumming around online.  I *think*. =)

I also found out today that I will be visiting Seattle for two days in February.  I guess that's alright...
