Our team hit our goal for the quarter!  Regardless of hitting the goal, we decided to have a "play day" to rest from all the hard work we did, so we went to the lake and went kayaking/canoeing.  Here are some pics:

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Oh but I
Need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
And when that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you the door
