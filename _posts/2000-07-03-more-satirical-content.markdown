Well, found some more satirical (am I spelling that right?) news at <a href="http://www.satirewire.com" target="_blank">SatireWire</a>. Here's a funny little nerd "news-brief":

> <i>Cupertino, Cal. (SatireWire.com) - Symantec issued an                     apology to Microsoft yesterday after the security                     software maker's AntiVirus Research Center issued an                     alert for a "widespread and lethal virus known to cause                     system crashes and data loss" that turned out to be the                     Windows 2000 operating system. Symantec CEO John                     Thompson called it a "regrettable but understandable"                     mistake.
