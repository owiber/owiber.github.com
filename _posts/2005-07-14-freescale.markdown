So... not much has happened at Freescale as of yet.  I got a pager (one of the text messaging ones... but it's massive and old =/) and have listened to a bajillion people talk about Freescale.  A decent amount of those were managers though trying to get us to come to do one rotation with them and a few of them were interesting (although most of them were heavy on the EE side, but a few good software ones).

Oye, getting up at 7AM's tough! Though, I think my sleeping schedule will normalize soon and it shouldn't be so bad anymore (but then, I might be waking up later cause I'll prob. be able to show up to work later =).

Wellllll.... food time.
