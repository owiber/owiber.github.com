I wish I could somehow convey the way "Work! Work!" is supposed to be said.  To those who have played Warcraft 3, it should sound like the peons when you click on them. =)

I've been having severe motivation problems going to work recently.  I wake up and I just don't want to go.  That's not good.  Currently, I'm trying to figure out why some darn Gstreamer plugins won't build and I absolutely <i>hate</i> debugging build issues.  They really tick me off.

I think that's a big reason why I like a lot of common web tools like PHP and Perl... there's no compiling.  Development environments just seem so much simpler with them.  *shrug*

I think I might take a break from running today... but I'm not sure yet.  The past few days I went running by my lonesome have been pretty nice though (weather is gooood =), so maybe I'll be in the mood when I leave work...

So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, w-o-o-o-oh" - ABBA</blockquote>
