After seeing his pic(s;) on <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/friends2000/minix.shtml">his Friends 2000 page</a>, Minix decided to have some revenge... <a href="http://www.mercury-x.net/oliver.html">Behold</a>. Lol, it's pretty funny. =) Make sure you have the Flash plug-in installed (if you can see the OliverWEB intro, you're fine). BTW, I will be changing Minix's pic (and the other temporary ones) soon... oh yeah, and here are screenshots of what Minix's page is/was:<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/images/screen.jpg" width="243" height="158" border="1"><br /><br /><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/images/screen2.jpg" width="243" height="150" border="1"></center><br /><br />Hehehe... first image is inside joke, btw. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
