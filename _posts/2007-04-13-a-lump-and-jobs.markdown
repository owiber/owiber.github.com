So I went to the doctor this morning and found out that the lump in my foot is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cyst">ganglion cyst</a>, which is rather harmless.  That is good. =)

My company, Bazaarvoice, which is quite awesome, is looking to hire a lot of people.  Check out the <a href="http://www.bazaarvoice.com/jobs.html">jobs page</a> and drop me an email if you're interested.  I cannot express how exciting and fun it is to work there. =)
