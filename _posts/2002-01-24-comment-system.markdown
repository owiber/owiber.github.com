Well, since I have SO MANY news items now... it now takes the server a bit of time to update each time someone submits a comment...<br /><br />Therefore, I've disabled the refresh thing for everytime a news item is commented upon (since it was refreshing the news everytime in order to have a current number of comments listed... ie: "Comments(x)").<br /><br />This basically means that you'll have to check each comment page and can't just look at the number anymore to see if it's changed... I know it might be a little bit more of a hassle... but sorry. =) On the "bright side" everytime a new news posts is added, the numbers are updated. Alrighty... <br /><br />-Oliver
