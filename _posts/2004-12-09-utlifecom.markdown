Haha, sometimes... the reviews on <a href="http://www.utlife.com">UTLife.com</a> are wonderful. Look at this one:<blockquote><i>From a student who took EE 313 - 04/23/03
 Avoid Aggarwal like the plague! If there are only two choices for EE313 and one is Aggarwal and the other is Adolf Hitler... take Hitler, or just wait a semester and see if anyone else teaches the class. Trust me, you'll regret it if you sign up for this turtle-like man.

 His grading is by far the worst part. Homework is given twice a week and consists of problems that usually have nothing to do with his lectures. They are graded with a gratuitous use of the letter X with absolutely no explanation of why you got a problem wrong - not even a correct answer is given. Exams are the same way, but even worse. If you miss part B of a certain question, but you need that answer for part C of the same question, just kiss your grade goodbye.

 He stutters like some sort of walking-seizure during lecture. In the whole hour, he might only say three words. None of these would be relevant to anything, of course. Sometimes, he acted as confused as the class. Often, a student would have to explain where he went wrong in trying to solve an example on the board.

 I've heard that every other teacher for 313 is awesome, so if you were thinking of taking Aggarwal then just stop thinking! Check yourself into Bellvue and say hello to your friend, Mr. Straightjacket...</i></blockquote>
Haha... awesome.
