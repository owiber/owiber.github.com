I should have written this yesterday, but as it is apparent (see previous post), I was lazy. =)<br /><br />Andrew, Mark and I started the day at 6/7AM ramping up to compete in <a href="http://ipsc.ksp.sk/">IPSC</a>.  I don't care how nerdy/geeky/weird that makes us, but we all had a pretty fun time I think.  Those darn Russians and Chinese middle schoolers. Cheaters! Haha. =)<br /><br />We managed to get 4 points which put us right around the 50% mark compared to all the other teams.  If we had played a bit smarter, I'm pretty sure we could have broken 8 points, putting us at around the top 100 (winning team got 19 out of a max of 24... there were probably around 500 - 600 teams).  Oh well, there's always next year.<br /><br />I don't really feel like doing a top whatever list for this past year, but definately major shout-outs go Sam and the little fishies he brought along (that'd be Paul and Nathan =).  Definately glad I chose to room with you Sam and getting to you know (corrupting? =) you guys better has been really really cool. Global domination begins behind the Target in August '04. lol<br /><br />-Oliver
