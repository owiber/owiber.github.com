So I got bored and I went back and found archives of my "blog" posts from 1999-2004.  Back then, there weren't many (if any) blog platforms, so I was using some funky "news" posting software.  Apparently it stored all the posts in a text file with delimiters of "``x"...

Anyways, I whipped up a quick script to convert it into an XML format WordPress could import and... <a href="https://www.owiber.com/category/oldpost/?order=ASC">tada</a>!  I wouldn't be surprised if links were broken, by the way...

It's kind of crazy to see over ten years worth of blogging on the right sidebar now...
