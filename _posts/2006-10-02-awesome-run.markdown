One of the other ERPs in my class was telling me about how he once interned in Washington D.C. and would wake up every morning and run around watching the sun rise among all the monuments and stuff.  I was just listening to the Top Gun Anthem and man, it would be awesome to do that run listening to that on my Andrew Approved iPod.  I think one day, I might go to random places and do a morning jog around parts of the city.  I want to take my camera too, but DSLRs can be kinda tricky to jog with... haha...

Edit:  Oh, maybe I can put a light lens on my 5D and a heavier one of the Rebel XT so they'd weight similarly and jog with one in each hand like people do with weights... haha...

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Cause I want someone to share my smile
To share the pain
To be there when the sea turns gray
To share the joy
For better or worse
And I thought that it might have been her
I thought that it might have been her" - Switchfoot</blockquote>

I think I like that song because of its clever title: "It Might have Ben Hur"

Edit Edit:  I realized I would probably get mugged like no other running around with two DSLRs in D.C....  well, possibly not, the hoodlums might not wake up so early in the morning.
