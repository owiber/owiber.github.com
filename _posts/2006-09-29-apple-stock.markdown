Bought some Apple stock back in January before the MBPs were announced.  Since then, the stock went down and I was in the hole for a while, but it's since risen back up and I'm making a very tiny bit now, haha.  It seem as if "iPhone" rumors are gaining a bit more substance and I think that type of product is very likely in the Apple pipeline (disclaimer: none of this is speculation based upon information I have gained at work) as they've all but said they're working on one.  I think an Apple cellphone could be pretty cool... I hope they allow Nike+ to work on it as it would be nice to bring a cellphone on a jog (I usually leave mine in the car).  Anyways, if the rumors are true, I think they'd probably cell a decent amount of them, especially once they break out of carrier exclusives.  I'm considering picking up a few more shares... but I don't really know if it's worth it (probably not, actually... since I don't really have enough money to buy a significant amount).

Olivia has been learning the ways of my mother in the culinary arts, it seems.  I went over to her place tonight and she made me food.  Yay!  Haha, good job, little sister, thanks. =)  And that Oink... he's getting large.

Oh yeah, apparently two (at least) mosquitoes hitched a ride in my car and bit me a total of about eight times.  It is not cool.  Curse you, blood sucking fiends!

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Looking in your eyes I see a paradise
This world that I've found
Is too good to be true
Standing here beside you
Want so much to give you
This love in my heart that I'm feeling for you

...

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us now" - Starship</blockquote>

Haha, that song reminds me of the lovely 80's movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093493/">Mannequin</a>... haha.  The tagline from IMDB is: "Just because Jonathan's fallen in love with a piece of wood, it doesn't make him a dummy."  Haha, that's awesome.
