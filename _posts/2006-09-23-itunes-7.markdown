Yay, shin doesn't hurt so much anymore! =)

In other news (and the main point of this post), iTunes 7 is the lame.  Whenever I play music and start up Frozen Throne (supposedly other things can trigger it too), all the songs start getting distorted and have static/noise.  Even when I quit the game, iTunes still continues to play songs horribly.  Looking around, this seems to be a pretty common issue and I think Apple knows about it, but they're taking a while patching it.  Changing the sound output in Quicktime from 24-bit to 16-bit didn't help me.  Meh, now I'm trying to decide if I want to try reverting to iTunes 6 or just waiting around until iTunes 7 is fixed.  You would think they'd do a bit more testing on the audio playback portion of a program whose primary function is to play music, eh?
