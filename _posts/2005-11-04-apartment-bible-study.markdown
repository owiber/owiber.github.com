Tonight we had our first weekly Thursday night apartment Bible study.  After years of "we should"s, we finally broke down and made it happen. W00t w00t!

We're going through Hebrews and we somewhat arbitrarily chose chapters one through five, which actually turned out to be a really good summary of the basic elements of Christianity. Pretty nifty.  Next week, six to nine... some more hardcore issues...
