So Brook and I were up until 5AM or so just talking about all kinds of things like <a href="http://www.liquid-acc.com">Liquid</a>, relationships, etc. etc.  Then Chad popped in and we eventually drifted into politics... Mark later joined the fun and I ended up not sleeping until probably around 7AM. Three hours of sleep, baby! ZZzzzzz...

My mom and Olivia dropped by this morning to deliver <a href="http://www.roundrockdonuts.com/">Round Rock donuts</a>. Hotness.
