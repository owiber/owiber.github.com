I'm back from my cross-country road trip. What a blast! I still can't believe we drove all that way. Anyways, just wanted to say what up! Hope everyone had a good 4th of July. I should have some pics of the trip up by the end of this week if anyone wants to see them. *NOTE* - quotes on the quote page that Sean places up saying I said are going to be false 99.99% of the time! Punk! Well....back to work...school.. bah!<br /><br />-Ochs
