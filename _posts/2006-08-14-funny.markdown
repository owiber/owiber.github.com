<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/214691443/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/69/214691443_a10682ed2d_o.jpg" width="497" height="90" alt="andrewinfountain" /></a>

Haha, for some reason, when I read "Nobody counts Andrew in the fountain as a favorite" I started laughing.  Don't know why, but I find it funny. =)

Spent a bit today trying to brainstorm ideas for OWeb '07, but that wasn't very successful.  My creativity in web design kinda comes and goes randomly and I can't force these things, so after a while of things not working, I just gave up.  I might drop the dirty/high-tech look cause I don't think I'm very good at creating good looking dirt, haha.  We'll see...

I want more..."</i> - Ariel (The Little Mermaid)
