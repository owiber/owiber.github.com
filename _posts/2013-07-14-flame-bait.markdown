Alright, for better or worse, here's my opinion on all the crazy. I may be wildly inaccurate on information that leads me to these opinions, so if you have points you think I should be aware of, don't hesitate to enlighten me. =)

HB2 - it seems to me that if this bill went through and led to no clinic closures, no one would have an issue. Is that correct? On paper, the bill is focused on improving the quality of care and making it safer for women, or that's the claim as I understand it. The issue is that this is seen as an underhanded way of closing down a majority of clinics because most of them will be unable to meet the bar set forth in the bill, right? I suppose my thoughts then are:

<ul>
<li>How accurate is it that a majority of clinics will close down?</li>
<ul>
<li>For example, how influenced by profit are these clinics? Are they incentivized to claim they'll be forced to close?</li>
<li>Even if the ones do close down, is it unlikely that new ones open that do sufficiently meet the bill's requirements?</li>
<li>The math must be doable... has someone calculated the financial feasibility of running a clinic while abiding by the bill's requirements?</li>
</ul>
<li>Which specific aspects of the bill are unreasonable? IMO, it seems that at least some of them are fine.</li>
</ul>

This bill's gotten a lot of media/social attention by pulling in "women's rights" into it and if it's in fact true that the bar set in this bill leaves it financially impossible to offer appropriate services to women in need, then I don't doubt that it ends up achieving something counter to what it's supposed to on paper, and that would be bad. I'm not entirely sure if I'm convinced this bill is ALL bad though, but I can definitely see how it could be if it does in fact lead to an increase in illegal abortions from potentially dangerous sources. I feel like a lot of people jumped on the "protecting women's rights" bandwagon (which is not a bad thing), but I'm curious... is there a version of this bill that <em>would</em> be deemed "good?" Certainly there's a set of abortion sources that are currently illegal and dangerous and should remain that way. Or are there people out there who feel like even those should be legal in the name of "rights" and "choice?"

Zimmerman/Martin - Zimmerman's verifiable actions (those backed up by his call to the police and eye witness accounts), though potentially deemed unwise, are reasonable for someone to take, especially given the history of crime in the area and that he was head of the neighborhood watch. Neither Zimmerman nor Martin did anything legally wrong until someone made the first move to assault the other. The evidence seems to shift against Martin at this point, but it doesn't seem like anyone knows who "threw the first punch" conclusively. At the very least, there is not sufficient evidence to counter Zimmerman's claims and his account of what happens seems at the very least plausible. It very well could be that he got away with cold-blooded murder, but "innocent until proven guilty" is what we generally run with over here. I don't think anyone can reasonably say he was proven guilty with the evidence on the table. I also think this case is more racially charged than it needs to be and the media has made Zimmerman out to be more "racist" than the facts seem to indicate.

Snowden - Doesn't seem so bad.
