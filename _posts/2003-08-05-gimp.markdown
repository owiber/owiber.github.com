After a long while of abstaining from using GIMP because of it's horrible (well, IMHO) UI compared to Photoshop (okay, maybe that's just because I'm used to PS now)... I took a stab at 1.3.17 (the latest devel version), and I must say, I am VERY VERY impressed by how much they've improved it.<br /><br />Now, they have a menu bar above the image, as well as the crazy right click menu, which is very helpful because I hated that right click thing (again, probably just used to Photoshop).  It didn't import my PSD's very nicely, but that's alright, just would have been a nice perk.  There are a few nice things missing (ie. preview on a lot of the filters/script-fu's) but it definately is getting there.<br /><br />I'd say give it another few months and I may begin trying to use it instead of Photoshop for my designs.  GOOOOO (legally =) FREE SOFTWARE!<br /><br />-Oliver
