My sisters love it when I expose them to terrible entertainment.

When I made Oriana watch High School Musical with me:

Then, she was super happy when we moved on to Taylor Swift: Journey to Fearless:

The above shenanigans have humorously led to the following:

And... here's some random photo dumping...

On Valentine's, Oriana and I went to Amy's with the pups:

Mozilla's support was not enough for the 49ers to win:
