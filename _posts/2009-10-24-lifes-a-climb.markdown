Friday night, I went to eat at Asia Cafe with the BV crew, which included two of Steph's visiting friends.  Then, we played some Rock Band and I messed with my studio lights:

Afterwards, we watched Hannah Montana: The Movie, and let me tell you... I can now die in peace.

I feel like I'm still in UK time as I get tired pretty early but I'm having an easier time waking up in the morning... so off to bed for me.  I shall leave you with a quote from the awesome movie of tonight:

"Life's a climb... but the view is great."
