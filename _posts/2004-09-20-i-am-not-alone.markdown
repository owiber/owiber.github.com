Apparently, people are just walking out of my EE class one by one (as I am typing this).  I think the class is half the size it was when it started 40 minutes ago... haha.  So, I'm not the only one that views this guy's lectures as absolutely worthless.<br /><br />In other news, I got a job offer from Freescale, and I have to read A LOT of Buddhism for the test on Thursday.  Wheeeee.<br /><br />Infiniti G35 Coupe here I come! =)<br /><br />-Oliver
