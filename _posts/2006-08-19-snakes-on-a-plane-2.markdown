Saw <a href="http://www.snakesonaplane.com/">Snakes on a Plane</a> yesterday with Kathy and Sam at that cursed far south theater, Westgate.  It was actually not as bad as I thought it would be and the crowd was very much like one you'd expect at an Alamo Drafthouse (probably because it was an early showing).  I hear that originally the movie was supposed to be serious?  If so, someone up in the movie business ranks made a brilliant decision to overhype this movie into oblivion and make it blatantly obvious it wasn't to be taken seriously.

I had a fun time watching it and Samuel L. Jackson was great fun too, haha...

Worked on a new OliverWEB design a bit a few nights ago... it's coming along okay, but I think it's still a bit too plain so I'll be tweaking it a little/lot over the next month or two.  Yipppeeeeeeeeee...
