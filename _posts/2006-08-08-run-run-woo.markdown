So today was the fourth time in the last five days that I ran around Town Lake... it does feel good I suppose, haha... and I guess I gotta start curbing the diabetes onset sometime. =)

I finally got my new laptop at work, however, it wasn't configured to log onto the Freescale intranet, so I was kinda stuck not being able to use it all day.  Kinda stinks to have it just sitting there next to me and not be able to use it.  I hate corporate bureaucracy. =)

That's some wisdom there, folks. Haha... I'm just joking. ;)
