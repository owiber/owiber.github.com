I went all over town (and by all over town, I basically mean up Mopac with slight deviations) doing random things and went to Target to get a duffle bag for my workout gear that usually is just randomly thrown around in the back seat or trunk of my car.  Anyways, while I was there I passed by the back-to-school section when a pink basketball bounced in front of me from who knows where.  Well, I figured it was fate so I picked it up and bought it... uhh... for Oriana, of course... yeah...

Okay, time to mess with apartment networking... giga giga!
