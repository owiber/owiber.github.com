Well, looks like I didn't blog yesterday.  I think since like... August 3rd, I only missed one day in August... oh well. =)

Tomorrow, I'm supposed to do the Hairy Man 5k, but I haven't ran in over a week and I'm not sure if my shin is up to it yet.  We'll see.  I'm considering not running it and waiting for Race for the Cure, but the idea of waking up at 6, getting Round Rock donuts, then running the 5k at 8, seems exciting and fun.  Haha... I had a dream the other day that I put on my running shoes and ran around some lake and did three miles easy.  I have a feeling it's not going to be like that tomorrow.

I brought my camera to work with me today, I feel like taking some pictures.  Might go roaming around after work today...

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Through my glasses glare
you'll see savoir faire
beneath my icy stare
I've got a retainer
Maybe I'm the physics main event
maybe I'm the chem club president
maybe even Texas Instruments
thinks that I'm coplanar
If you're up
and if you want
a piece of me
wave goodbye and blow a kiss
Cause you can't handle this" - Five Iron Frenzy</blockquote>
