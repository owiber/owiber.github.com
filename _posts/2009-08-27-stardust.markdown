Came home from work today to find Oriana watching Stardust at my place.  Mom came and picked her up, but I went ahead and finished watching it.  I've seen it before, but there's something about it that makes me enjoy it quite a bit.  I think it's probably something to do with slightly overly chipper girls... they get to me, I suppose. =p  Although the downside to that is that I know it's fake... there's no such thing as overly chipper girls. =(  Haha... ;)  How cool would it be to have a girl that could blow up witches by supernovaing though (without blowing themselves up, of course)?
