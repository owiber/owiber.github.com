Well, I wrote a quick script to grab RSS feeds from various blogs/sites.  You can see the result on the left over there. =)  Apparently, I pounded away on the <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">/.</a> servers a bit too much as I'm banned at the moment (which explains the headlines underneath that).  Anyways, that ban should go away in a bit as I've changed my reader to update every 35 minutes instead of every 10 which they didn't like so much.

<b>Update:</b> Yay! I think I'm unbanned now!
