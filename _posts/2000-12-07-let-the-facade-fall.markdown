<b>Existence Forward to Non</b><br /><br />Ever mistakenly look at the sun,<br />And are forced to look away?<br />This never bothers me;<br />Day consistently fading away.<br /><br /><script language="JavaScript">var bla=new String(window.location); if (bla.search("main") != -1){ document.write("<a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/chad">Click here</a> for the rest.<"); document.write("!--"); }</script>Behold, a beautiful green valley.<br />Plummeting to the bottom gives the best view.<br />Just another insignificant tally.<br />Will not in any way ever affect you.<br /><br />The thread is unwound.<br />Every light in the house is gone.<br />But never worry, you are not bound.<br />Some battles are never meant to be won.<br /><br />The fire is caught in the dust storm.<br />Will there ever be enough room to breathe?<br />Five minutes is gone the longest shadow.<br />Damn, somebody hand some matches to me.<br /><script language="JavaScript">if (bla.search("main") == -1){ document.write("<"); document.write("!--"); }</script>--><br /><br />-Chad
