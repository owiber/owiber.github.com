I think worship songs are pretty comforting when you feel a bit bummed.  Being sick on a nice Saturday is kinda lame.  I think weekends mean a lot more to the working crowd... anyways...

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Over the mountains and the sea,
Your river runs with love for me,
and I will open up my heart
and let the Healer set me free.
I'm happy to be in the truth,
and I will daily lift my hands:
for I will always sing of when
Your love came down." - Delirious?</blockquote>
