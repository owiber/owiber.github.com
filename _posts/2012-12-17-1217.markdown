Well, it's been a year <a href="http://www.owiber.com/2012/02/14/valentines-day/">since</a>. I've found myself to be noticeably more emotional this past year (though perhaps not outwardly). I don't consider that a bad thing, but here's an emotional post for ya.

A year ago, things were pretty sucky. Despite that, I continue to have so much to be thankful for that in reflection of everything that's happened, I consider myself extremely blessed. As I've previously mentioned, I view Mozilla as kind of a symbol of all the love and support I got during a dark time in my life. He was kind of a poetic gift to myself to cap off a depressing time with something positive. Maybe that's cheesy, I don't care. =) Sometimes you don't see or value the gems in your life as much when everything's peachy. My friends and family were awesome for us and whenever I have a quiet time to contemplate everything's that's happened, I can't help but come out of it with a kind of solemn happiness. So, in that spirit, I'm going to cap off this dark anniversary by talking about the ladies in my life, my mother and sisters.

Before I get to my family, a quick shout out to Nancy because she's like the big sister I don't have and a year ago she gave me a perfect hug right when I needed it and I'll never forget that. All of my friends were great during that time, but since Nancy's the girl of "the group" she tends to be my emotional vent more often than not. Maybe next time I'll talk about what my guy friends did, because they were definitely there for me too.

So... I've been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to buy my mom a car a few years back. She gave me no sense of obligation to do so, but it just kind of made sense. I got her a new RAV4 and while presenting it to her, she mentioned how she's wanted a car like it so she could carry kids to/from church, and other ways she could serve others. The things that make her happy allow her to love and serve others even better and that's why she's awesome and we love her.

This is a picture of Oriana at her baptism back in 2007:

I'm pretty sure this was shortly after she mentioned our mom. I'm also pretty sure that before she finished her sentence, there was not a dry eye anywhere in the room. I'm not a good enough writer to even get close to describing how powerful I found this moment, but I hope you can get a glimpse of the love my mom's given us in our lives by knowing that a young high schooler brought a room full of people to tears by barely conveying the words "mom" and "love." Everyone who knows my mom knows that she's a bottomless pit of love. She's one of the biggest reasons I believe there's a God. The love she's given me and my siblings, not to mention the other people she's positively touched, is too powerful, too beautiful, to merely be a result of chemistry and physics. I would not be where I am today, or the person I am today, if she wasn't in my life. Her love gives me a glimpse of Love, and I couldn't ask for a better reason to have faith. I'm so blessed to have her as my mom, it's almost not even fair. ;)

Olivia is, as my mom says, "the spicy one." As siblings two years apart, I'm sure we went through the typical love/hate relationship that many go through. I'm happy that that flip flopping ended up on the love side though. =p Olivia's certainly the more extroverted of us, but I like to think we balance each other out pretty well. She gave me the worst present I've ever gotten - a sheet of half-used stickers. Her fear of E.T. allowed me to pay her back well enough though when I bought a plush toy of him off eBay and put him in the hallway facing her room. =)

We've both grown to be foodies, and it's fun to enjoy and share awesome food experiences we've had. We also both enjoy ruining Oriana's food. I fulfill my quota of making her angry every so often, I'm sure, but I know we love each other and it makes me happy to think about growing up together and perhaps someday in the future, having larger family reunions where I can have my kids torment hers.

My mom says that I never hit Olivia, although I do remember one time when I punched her in the head. That said, she was wearing a karate helmet, so maybe that doesn't count? =p Instead, I resorted to psychological warfare and just annoyed her like crazy, which you can even see in this video of us fighting at a young age:

Once, I made her so angry she kicked a shoe at me. I dodged it and she ended up breaking a window. My mom didn't punish her though, cause I guess she understood how annoying brothers can be. =) I have a lot of memories of Olivia, and I'm happy I do. She's been my sister since as far as my memory goes back and I wouldn't have it any other way. <3

Oriana is my baby sister, eight years younger than me. Given the large age difference, we never really fought, but we also didn't really play with each other as much as she and Olivia did (expected, I suppose). I annoyed Olivia a lot to get even, but I do it to Oriana just for fun. ;) I once walked in her room as she was reading and just let drool fall out of my mouth onto her leg. She gave me a quite satisfying yell when she realized what was going on.

I remember trying to make her stop crying as a baby, and trying to change her diaper with Olivia. Now, she's about to turn 21 next month and that's crazy. Oriana likes to gives me hugs, and I appreciate that because I like hugs, but I don't often initiate. She lives with me now as she's going to school at UT, which is pretty cool even though most of the time we just sit quietly. We're the introverts, so I think we understand each other there. =)

She gives me good fodder for my videos, like this one:

I hope she knows I tease her to show my love, which I guess means I love her a lot.

Life sometimes sucks, but I'm glad I went through it with these women and I was there for them and they were there for me.
