Tomorrow, I shall wake up in the world of the "grown-ups."  Full time job, no summer, no homework, fat paychecks...

Nancy asked me Sunday morning if I was excited... I'm not really.  I'm kinda excited on what projects I'll be working on and such, but man... Oliver's grown-up?  I don't think I quite grasp that after working for three months, I won't be returning to UT.  I guess I have a similar feeling to when I graduated.  Just seemed like I would be older, have more things figured out than I do now and such crazy things like that when I entered the "grown-ups" world.  Alas, I feel like I could just as easily be waking up to walk into AP English and hear moans and groans about Hamlet or play Magic: The Gathering in the cafeteria during lunch. Haha...

I don't feel grown-up... I'm feeling pushed... shoved into the next stage of my life.  I guess I'm ready, I'm not scared... I just can't believe it. =)

Well guys, here goes nothing!
