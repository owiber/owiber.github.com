I would like to "publish" the playlist that Andrew, Mark and I made and listened to (virtually EVERY song) on Saturday morning of the LAN party. I believe Brook woke up to Zipi Dee Doo Da... or something that had something about a happy or sunny day...<br /><br />Oh, and <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/music.txt>this</a> is the little perl script I wrote to parse the WinAmp file to extract all the names of the songs... if you're interested. ;) Gosh... I love Perl so much... it's so easy... and useful...<br /><br />Just click on the comments to view the list (all 101 songs =).<br /><br />-Oliver
