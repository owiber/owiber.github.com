Hehehe... well, hopefully you guys find the stolen item and we didn't spoil the night too much. Just wanted to add a bit of excitement to your party. ;)<br /><br />On another note, I got the following email from Blizzard:

> <i>Welcome to the Warcraft(R) III: The Frozen Throne(TM) Battle.net(R) Beta Program<br /><br />You made it! Once again we are in the process of putting a new Blizzard game through its paces in preparation for launch, and we are excited that you can join us. We have been playing a lot of The Frozen Throne around the office and find many of the new features and units hard to play without.</i>

<br />Hehehe, so Mark... when you wanna do an AT? =)<br /><br />-Oliver
