I woke up from a nap and checked my email, and apparently some business school freshman named Denise Ward sent out an email to all her classes next semester with that stupid "Microsoft will give you money if you forward this to other people" email. ARGH!!!!!!!!!!  In fact, I'm signed up for two classes she's in, so I got the email <i>twice</i>!

I swear, business majors, you need to weed out these kinds of people if you want any credibility whatsoever.
