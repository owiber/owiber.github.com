Well, camping last weekend was CRAZY. lol...

BTW, someone should tell Motorola they should have made the <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=V8%20slvr">V8 SLVR</a> the iTunes phone.  All they needed to do is make the wheel in the center of it, a scroll wheel (like the iPod), not impose a 100 song limit, and walla, $$$!  Instead they had to release that terrible ROKR. *sigh*

Of course, I kinda think Apple wouldn't let them do that...
