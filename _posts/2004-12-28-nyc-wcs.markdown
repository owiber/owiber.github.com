While in NYC, we've come up with some plans on what to do if certain "worst case scenarios" arise. Here they are:

1. Someone points a knife at us and tells us to hand over our money.

<i>Solution: Turn, kick Sam in the knees and run.  Optionally, throw down a $20 or two on Sam's body on the ground... then run.</i>

2. We "accidently" punch another group of kids in the face.

<i>Solution: Turn, kick Sam in the knees and run.</i>

3. Knees are kicked in, can't run.

<i>Solution: You're Sam... sorry, can't help.</i>
