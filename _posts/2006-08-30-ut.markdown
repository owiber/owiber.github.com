Have a good semester/year, peeps. =)

Was around campus a few times the past week or two and it made me start to miss it a lot.  Poo.  Maybe it won't be so bad once everyone I know there has graduated, but I liked walking around campus with the swarms of people everywhere.  I think what I miss the most is random campus meets like lunches, late night snacks, and all that stuff.  It is nice to never have to worry about homework and tests now though and I have more money, haha...

I've got one idea for <a href="http://www.owiber.com">owiber.com</a>, but I'm not sure if it will conflict too much with OliverWEB... I may not be able to keep both updated concurrently... so we'll see.

So I've been considering running around Town Lake without a shirt so that I don't get an absurd farmer's tan... but right now, I currently have a very visible heart on my chest which is making me hesitate a bit... lol.

Edit: Forgot lyrics. =)

With every single guy in town" - Dion</blockquote>
