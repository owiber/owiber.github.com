I've been slacking on the blogging a bit. =)

So I have found out that once I've reached a consistent sleeping/eating schedule and that's thrown off, my body feels all weird and out of wack.  Kinda like I can't tell when/if I'm hungry or tired or whatever anymore and I feel like I'm half-hungry/half-tired all the time, haha.  Anyways, guess that's why I should keep to my "schedule" I suppose. =p

This week I caught up on Heroes, Lost, and Battlestar Galactica, all of which have been highly enjoyable.  Recommended. =)  I also have not been running in an attempt to let my shin heal up, so we'll see how that goes.  I would like to run the <a href="http://www.komenaustin.org">Race for the Cure</a> on the 5th...

I've posted these before... like two years ago, but whatever, it's fun...

<blockquote class="lyrics">"Sometimes I wonder
If I’ll ever find her
The one that God’s chosen for me
And what if I find her,
But she doesn’t like me,
I guess that disproves destiny
But I should know better,
The sea is much wetter
With plenty of fishes to see
(For you and me)
And I know my Father
Has scoped out the water
And picked out a fishy for me" - Philmore</blockquote>
