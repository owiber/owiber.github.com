So I got bored Sunday and "somehow" managed to finagle myself into getting a 27" iMac.  I talked to Ryan about it as I contemplated it after a few hours of surfing around researching it and the conversation quickly went from "what in the world do you need an iMac for?" to "well, you might as well get the big one."  In the middle of our discussion, I called Chad saying "he'd understand."  He did, of course, and also suggested I get the big one. =)

Well, the thing has a pretty big beast of a screen and it's pretty zippy with its Core i5.  It'll serve me well in photo editing (and hopefully video eventually).

On Saturday, we had our usual Ultimate game, but my leg was cramping the entire time so that made it tricky for me to run.  It's still feeling cramped, so I'm thinking I may have actually pulled it because I don't think it can cramp for over a day or two...

I've gone through and reread the entirety of <a href="http://www.mrtechhappy.com">MrTechHappy.com</a> and found it really amusing.  There was a while there where we were really on a roll (even if the jokes were many times inside ones) and I actually really laughed out loud at various times.  Those were good times.  I'm seriously considering trying to get Mark committed into giving a web comic another go, if only to provide myself entertainment in a few years.
