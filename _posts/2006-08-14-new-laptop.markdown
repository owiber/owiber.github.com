I finally got my new laptop delivered to me by IT today and it is so much better than my last one, it's not even funny.  Yay, now to get productive!

Oh, but wait, I have to install all my software again... doh... so here I am sitting watching three or four download progress windows slowly inch their way to completion as I type this blog entry.  How entertaining!

I'm not sure what's given me my drive to keep up with running around Town Lake, but it's still alive and kicking thus far.  Maybe it was all those things Nancy said would happen to me once diabetes has gobbled me up like a tasty treat.  Or maybe it's because I've somehow managed to find it nice spending time by myself and running around Town Lake is a good opportunity to spend the decent portion of an hour by my lonesome.

Yesterday, I spent some time kicking the punching/kicking bag at my parents' house and now I'm a bit sore.  It's been a while since I've kicked for an extended period of time, I suppose... but it does feel good to kick something really hard sometimes. =)  I had a dream last night about sparing... that was fun.  I think sparing is the thing I miss most about karate...
