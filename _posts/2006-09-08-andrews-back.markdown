Andrew came back for the Texas/Ohio game and I went to pick him up at the airport yesterday.  The following emails were sent:

<blockquote><pre>Andrew Joseph to planeteers

I had to check in a bag Oli, so you can add an extra
30 minutes to my arrival time to pick me up.

Did you wear pinky pinky for him?</pre></blockquote>

Yes, in fact I did.  I know how much Andrew loves pink, especially when I have to do with it... haha.  Not only did I wear my pink polo, but I wore jeans and sandals too... two types of clothing I don't regularly wear... I didn't even own a pair of sandals until the last baptism.  I waited for Andrew at the baggage claim and saw him coming down the escalator.  First thing he does -- shakes his head.  Yay!

Tomorrow, I've got a wedding to shoot and I kinda want to watch the Texas/Ohio game... who else is watching it?

This song is dedicated to Viraj and his hands:

<blockquote class="lyrics">If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all?" - Daniel Bedingfield</blockquote>
