Saturday started off slow and I went to run a few errands, then we played our now usual Saturday Ultimate game.  I'm a bit more sore this time than usual, for some reason, but at least that means I actually gave myself a workout. =)  Julie and Dean came up to join us (though Julie didn't play) and we later went to Chancy's to hang out where I passed out and Sam took me home later.

Sunday was not too eventful, but I found out via Al's Facebook page that 94.7 was having their 90's weekend, so I tuned in to them for a lot of the day including throughout the Cowboys game.  My receiver apparently will still pass through the video output from the previous input if you switch to the radio tuner, which is pretty cool.  Nothing like watching a Cowboys game to <em>Kiss from a Rose</em> (thank you, Seal).

I've also uploaded another video from the BV All-Hands:
