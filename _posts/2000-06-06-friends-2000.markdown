I believe I have everyone on there that should be on there... I hope I didn't forget anyone, that would stink. =) Now all I need are pics, so make sure you get them to me, or I'll have to use your yearbook pic(s) =) (Yeah, that was a threat. =). Although, Minix could care less, I've already got the worst pics of him.... lol. Grace though... wouldn't like her 10th grade yearbook pic up, Nancy either... hehe...<br /><center><h1><a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/friends2000/index.shtml">Friends 2000!</a></h1></center><br /><br />-Oliver
