I finally launched TeetarSauce.com, the site dedicated to <a href="http://www.teetarsauce.com">Viraj Bhagat</a>!  I've owned the domain name for a while with changing intentions, but finally decided to put something together and get it live this weekend.

My sleep schedule has been kind of messed up this past week initially due to jet-lag, but I didn't do a whole lot to fix it.  I've been falling asleep at around 5PM with the intention of waking up in an hour or two, but I keep on sleeping through my alarms and waking up in the 3AM-5AM range.  However, with some help of some HoN play time, I managed to stay up until midnight last night so hopefully my schedule will have righted itself for this coming week.

It's also my mom's birthday today.  Happy birthday, mother!
