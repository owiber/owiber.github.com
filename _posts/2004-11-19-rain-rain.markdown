The rain inhibits my abilities to take pictures.  Actually, yesterday wasn't bad, I just wasn't sure if the rain weather was gone or not in the morning.

I think the class I'm closest to a B in at the moment is Linguistics (hmmm... might even have a B in there at the moment). The rest are looking pretty good I think.

I can't wait until Christmas! I'm done December 8th. =) This semester has been so incredibly nice to me... next semester probably won't be as kind. =(

Anyone know what I should study for GOV310L CLEP?
