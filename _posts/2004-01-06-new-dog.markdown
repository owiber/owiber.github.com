So we got a new dog today and found out Orbit had a minor tumor on his tail that needs to be removed (which will be done by tomorrow morning I believe).  I'll get up pictures sometime... Oriana originally wanted to name the new dog Oink, but after seeing it... he doesn't really look like an Oink, so the name's in the air (although, it probably must start with the expected 'O' letter).  I suggest Orc Muncher or Orc Crusher.  I'm leaning towards Orc Muncher now... but the final decision's up to Oriana. =)<br /><br />-Oliver
