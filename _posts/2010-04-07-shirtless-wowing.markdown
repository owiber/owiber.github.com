So yesterday we were all minding our own business playing WoW when Sam, who is sitting next to Brook, suddenly exclaims "wow, Brook, have you been working out?  It looks like you've got a hot bod under that shirt."  Brook blankly stares back at Sam as he goes on "...what would I need to do get you to take it off?"  Brook was pretty flabbergasted, but eventually gives in to Sam's wily ways under the condition that Sam also go shirtless.

Sam happily agrees and I managed to capture the moment with my handy camera.  I guess Sam just really wanted some man eye-candy next to him as he tanked ToC.  Whatever gives you motivation, I guess, Sammy.
