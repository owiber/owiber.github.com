I went to a coworker's wedding with Kathy on Friday and it was one of the best weddings I have attended.  Very light-hearted and fun with little/no stress in the air, haha.  Here are some shots from it:

Yesterday, we went to see TMNT and it was pretty enjoyable. =)  I won't say much more than that because there are people like Viraj out there that will be pissed if I say that Michelangelo is a party dude.  I was debating whether to get chicken strips or pizza and I had changed my mind to chicken strips, but Kathy said "how could you see TMNT and not get pizza?"  I then realized she was so right and it was true, I must get pizza.  The usual Raging Bull it was. =)
