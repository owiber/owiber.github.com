Okay, I'm seriously considering changing my middle name for reasons I won't dive into right now, but maybe you can ask me in person if you're really curious. The real point of this post is that I'm not entirely sure what I want to change it to. Currently, I have two comical front-runners and no other solid ideas.
<ol>
	<li>Danger</li>
	<li>Tyrone/Tirone</li>
</ol>

I don't think I could actually commit to going with Tyrone, but Danger is sounding fairly appealing to me at the moment. I'm looking for something clever/fun so if you have ideas, share!

Oh! I should mention... this is NOT and April 1st joke. =P

In other news, I found a wonderful program to make fake Magic cards and had a blast of a time creating Sam and Viraj cards. I'm sure Gene, Liang, Mark, and Sam can attest to the many giggles that came from my desk as I tinkered with this. I was so pleased with myself. Here are draft versions of two Virajs. You'll have to wait for the Sam one. I think I'm going to redo what I've got.
