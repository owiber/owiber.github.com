I was pleasantly surprised to see the FedEx "we missed you" doorknob paper slip this morning with "office" written in the "we left your package at ____" slot.  Yay!  So before driving out of the complex, I dropped by the office and got my iPod.  I grabbed my laptop on the way out as well so I could sync my music with it at work.  So now I'm jamming to my tunes on it and it's pretty nice I suppose.  No more lag caused by the hard drive spinning up when going to the next song. =)

I wish I had my camera here to take pictures of the awesome engraving on the back, but that'll have to wait until after I get back to the apartment.  I am looking forward to testing this Nike+ thing later today. =)

One thing is that it is so light and small that it feels a little cheap, especially the wheel portion... mmmmm... oh well, I just look at the back and it makes me happy. ;)
