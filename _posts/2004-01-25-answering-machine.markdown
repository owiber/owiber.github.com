Nathan and I have just deduced that the answering machine in our room is busted.  We need a new phone, this one is stupid.  So anyways, if you've left a message, we never got it.<br /><br />Oh yeah, Nathan and I changed the answering machine message... it's hip and cool and hop... dude.<br /><br />-Oliver
