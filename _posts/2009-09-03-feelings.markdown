Sometimes I get in the mood of watching a sad movie or something to make myself <em>feel</em>.  Maybe it's due to living in a fast-paced world, sometimes I want to just chill for a bit and take in life and have some deeper emotions that a rushed one doesn't allow.  I'm glad I <em>do</em> have the luxury to do that, but I find it interesting being introspective and thinking about all the various aspects of myself that need to "recharge" every so often.  I like having time to just take in life and how things are going because even though some things aren't perfect, some things are really frustrating, or some things just aren't going the way I'd want, life is pretty good overall and I've been blessed with more than I deserve.

If someone calls me emo, I will shoot them.

Light of the World.
Destroy the blindness
Peace Eternal.

Take this broken heart,
if it brings You praise,
Take this beaten soul,
shivering hands I will raise." - Brave Saint Saturn</blockquote>
