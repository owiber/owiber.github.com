For day two of Meatcation, as planned, we started smoking a large chunk of brisket and made our own sausages from scratch.  Here's a video of the sausage stuffing craziness:

<object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/QgeAOP25EH4&hl=en_US&fs=1&hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/QgeAOP25EH4&hl=en_US&fs=1&hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object>

I will say that our sausages were a great success despite there being doubt we could actually stuff them properly (we did not have the specific tools to make the job easy).  Andrew and I got creative (as you can see from the video above) and made it work.  For dinner, we also made our own BBQ sauce and cream corn.
