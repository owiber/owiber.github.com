Nope, I did not have a hangover, but I went to see Hangover with Al and Ryan.  It was pretty entertaining.  Beforehand, Al and I were trying to help Ryan find a car.  I thought he should get an old VW bus, Delorean, a new Camaro, or a Dodge Viper. ;p  Haha...

On Saturday, I switched back to Time Warner from AT&T.  It's pretty much picking the lesser of two evils, but my experience with TW has been a lot better than AT&T (at least for internet performance).  Sunday was pretty lazy, but I watched a few episodes of 30 Rock with Chancy.

Yeah... not a very eventful weekend. =)
