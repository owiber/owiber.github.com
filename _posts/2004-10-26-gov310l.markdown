Who wants to CLEP out?  I've signed up for:
<pre>Tue 11/30/04 	10:30 AM - 1:00 P 	BWY 104B</pre>at the <a href="https://wnt.cc.utexas.edu/~mec/index.cfm">testing center</a>.  BTW, anyone taken the CLEP already?  I want to know how much I should study beforehand... I think someone told me there's a packet somewhere that we can read and it pretty much tells us everything we need to know?
