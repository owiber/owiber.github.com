<br />Took <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72057594139832627/">some pictures</a> of Oriana before she went off to her 8th grade dance, then jetted down to UT for Van's (and Yeeland's, turns out!) graduation.  Unfortunately, didn't get to take pictures of Van with this family cause they didn't get there in time (before the ceremony), but I got some so-so shots Van and Yeeland walking across stage from afar (this is when a telephoto lens would come in handy... I should have borrowed Van's 70-200).<br />
Congrats to all those who are graduating! =)
