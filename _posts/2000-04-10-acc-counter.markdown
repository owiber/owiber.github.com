Well, in my many days of being a webmaster and staff for large sites, I've seen many prizes given to the special person to be the something'th visitor to a site. Such milestones as the 1000th or 1000000th visit is a big deal to a lot of sites and many give away stuff to the lucky visitor. I think I deserve a prize too.<p><center><img src=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/acc.gif height=100 width=290 border=0></center><p>It's not often when you beat the <i>first</i>(!) visitor to a site. The amazing thing is that even when I refreshed, I was still the 0th visitor! There must be some kind of disturbance in the force or something...<br /><br />-Oliver
