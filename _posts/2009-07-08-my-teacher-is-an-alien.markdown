When I was young (like elementary school), I used to love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Coville">Bruce Coville</a> books.  I was thinking about something to blog about tonight, I remembered there was a series that I started but never finished because the final book hadn't been written yet.  By the time it was, I had moved on from reading (I blame the education system for that one ;-)).

So... I'm thinking about picking up the entire "Aliens Ate My Homework" series and going through it on my staycation later this week... we'll see if that actually happens.  I don't really remember the plot, and I was a pretty big dork as a young Oliver so I'm a bit curious to go through it again and see what I think now that I'm young Oliver +15... extreme, turbo.

Speaking of young tweenage Oliver, I was looking at my <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/friends2000/">Friends 2000</a> page and apparently had not accepted at that point in time the awesomeness that is the years 10-13.  You'll notice that the pictures on the side pretty much skip all of my middle school years, haha - straight from elementary to high school.  Sometimes I wonder how I managed to get to high school without getting beaten up (nah, I'm just kidding, I was the bully :P... no, I'm kidding about that too).  I will find some pictures of the dreaded tweenage years and post them sometime.  It'll be fun!

Oh yeah, and another thing that happened today was that my mom sent us (her children) an email and addressed everyone as "Daughters."  The email thread:

Holding on to one another's hand
Trying to get away into the night

And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound" - Tiffany</blockquote>
