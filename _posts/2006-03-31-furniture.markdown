The one thing I'm looking forward to most about moving out into a new apartment is starting anew in respect to furniture.  I think everyone at the apartment's given up keeping it clean (since we're out in... not that much time), so it's an utter mess for the time being.  Something I am NOT looking forward to is the actual process of moving out. Yuck.

I think I'm going to go for a clean, minimalistic feel to at least my desk area.  I'm thinking maybe a clean light wood table top (with metal legs), or something like that. =)  My bed... well, we'll see about that. =)  I have a feeling I'm going to be throwing down a decent chunk of money to furnish my new abode... but at least it's not wasted money, I'll probably use all that stuff many years down the line...
