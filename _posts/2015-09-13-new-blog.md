Well, now that I've been a front-end developer for the brunt of my career, I've finally shamed myself into replacing/updating my blog. Naturally, this means almost no JavaScript (for now). ;p

Anyways, I've made the whole blog much more simple and switched from WordPress to just using GitHub Pages.

Maybe this means I'll blog more again, but don't count on it. ;)
