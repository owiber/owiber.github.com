Well, I succumbed then relatively quickly overcame my cold that left me feeling very... cold.  Yesterday, I was talking to Ryan after returning from his visit home when I suddenly felt incredibly cold despite the house being at basically the same temperature it had been the entire day.  After a while, I hid under a blanket and <em>still</em> felt cold until I piled another one on top of that.  I ended up sleeping in late and skipped work, but now I am feeling much better and much warmer.

On a side note, there seems to be something wrong with Photo Booth.  The file names it saves are a year in the future.  I checked my system clock and it's definitely correct... anyone else have this issue?
