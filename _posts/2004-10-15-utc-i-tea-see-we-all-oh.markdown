I actually took this picture yesterday in Buddhism, but it works cause my linguistics class is in <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/utc.html">UTC</a> too (and all the rooms look the same =). After this, I gotta go eat lunch, then I have lab hours for 2 hours, 30 minute break, <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/admin/utpd/defensive.html">defensive driving</a> from 5:30 - 8:30, then it's camping time!  I think.  Here's hoping I don't get lost on the way. =)

I found a <a href="http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/">cool extension</a> for <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox">Firefox</a> the other day.  It lets you change/edit style sheets dynamically, display borders around table/block elements and all kinds of other crazy stuff.  It's the HOTNESS.

Hmmm... I should make a "HOTNESS" stamp/button or something...
