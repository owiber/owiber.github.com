Haha, you know your blog is getting severely neglected when Sean tries to post a comment "Please remove this entire site due to lack of content" to your most recent post and Movable Type's blacklist blocks it due to it being posted on an "old entry."

Anyways, yesterday the power went out at UT for an hour while Brook, Viraj, Mark and I were watching Lemony Snicket. Poo... so we didn't get to finish watching it.  However, we did wander around DARK CAMPUS for a while and stumbled upon an evil Ben &amp; Jerry machine that was flickering red.  Later, we went back to the machine and we have no idea how it had such a red tint (the lights were white and the plastic was yellow =/).

Ummm... Nancy's probably changing my wallpaper (was Viraj's face in all its glory) to a more "heterosexual" image as I'm away from my computer in my lab hours.  Hmmm... that gives me an idea... I think I'll upload the Viraj wallpapers to OWeb soon...

Tata for now!
