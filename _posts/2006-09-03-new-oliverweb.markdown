Okay, so the new OliverWEB design has been pretty much stagnant for a while and I'm wondering if I should keep it under wraps for another month to play with and <i>possibly</i> tweak and improve more or just go ahead and switch to it a month early (I think this makes up for the year I was late... at least I *think* I was late one year... ;).

Anyways, if I switched now, I could focus on owiber.com and what I want to do with that a month earlier... if not, I'll just continue staring at the new design and maybe or maybe not improve upon it.  What do you guys think? =)

While we're on the topic, I'll show you one of the designs I ended up scrapping:

I decided I wanted something lighter/cleaner.  I also made a "messy" version of it, which I didn't like that much...

I decided to go with a clean design and I think I did pretty well.  The new one also uses a color scheme that is quite a bit different from any of my previous designs (yay!).  But you can't see it until I'm done (actually, truth be told, probably a ton of people have seen it in various states already, since I haven't exactly been working on it behind lock and key... hehe).
