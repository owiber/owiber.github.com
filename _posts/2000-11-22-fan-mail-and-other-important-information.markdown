Hey does everyone know what today is?  Today is a very special day... but what day is it?  Well, ok ok, I'll tell you... today is...<br /><br /><center><big><big><b><span style="color:red">O<span style="color:blue">L<span style="color:red">I<span style="color:blue">V<span style="color:red">I<span style="color:blue">A<span style="color:red">'<span style="color:blue">S <span style="color:lime">BIRTHDAY!<br /><span style="color:yellow"><big><big><i>Happy Birthday Olivia!<br /><br /></big></big></big></big></i></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></center></b><br />On a boring sidenote...several times a day, we now get Fan Mail for the Nine Inch Nose Hairs.  It's great!  Today however, we got my favorite fan email so far...  <br /><br />

> <i>Wow, not what I expected, but very funny!  I hit play at my desk at work and was diving for the speaker volume as our CFO was walking by, looking very suspiciously at my PC.  <br />"What the heck is that?" he said. <br />"I'm not sure, but they're from Austin" I replied.  <br />"Oh" he mumbled.  "Is that really Pat Buchanan?" he asked. <br />"I don't think so" I replied. <br />He went back to his office.  I don't think I'll see him near my desk for the rest of the day.  For that alone I owe you guys a big thanks<br /> <br />Greetings to Austin from my dark corner cubicle in New York<br /><br />Fred</i>

<br /><br /><br />If you're confused, we recorded a track called Buchanans Concession Speech about the elections... it was me talking, not Buchanan.  He admitted defeat, and well, its pretty funny.  If you want to hear it sometime, tell someone, we'll try and figure out a way you can.<br /><br /><br /><br />-Minix
