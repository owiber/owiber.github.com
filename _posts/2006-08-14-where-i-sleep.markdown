<br />This is where I sleep every night.  I've had that Disney blanket for who knows how long (a <i>long</i> time).  I wish I had old-school Strawberry Shortcake sheets, but alas, I had to resort to the new version.<br />
I should have exposed the Care Bears pillow cover (thanks Kathy =) under the blue pillow cover on that large pillow, but I forgot and I'm too lazy to take the picture again... that would have made it quite a bit more colorful and... goofy? haha...<br />
Also present in the pic are some gifts from Nancy and my mom (the red smiley thing and the book, respectively).<br />
