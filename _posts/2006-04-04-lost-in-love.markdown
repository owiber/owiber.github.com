I think I'm ODing myself on over-dramatic 80's/90's love songs, haha.  Yesterday, Chad suckered me into buying the 7+ minute version of It's <i>All Coming Back to me Now</i> which I initially missed because it was incorrectly titled on iTunes as <i>It's All Coming Back to Me Know</i>.  Bums!  Well, that song is utterly awesome because it's so dramatic and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_Loaf">Meat-Loaf-ish</a>.  When you have lyrics like this, there's not much that can stop me from smiling and being all giddy:<blockquote><i>"there were nights when the wind was so cold"

"there were days when the sun was so cruel"

"When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me"</i></blockquote>

Then, later, Kathy got me into listening to two other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Supply">Air Supply</a> songs which I promptly purchased as well.  I leave with you with an excerpt from <i>Lost In Love</i>:<blockquote><i>"Lost in love and I don’t know much
Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch?
But I’m back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I’ll show you a plan
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me"</i></blockquote>To balance out this swarm of love songs, also in my playlist are some songs from Top Gun in order to bring some manlyness to the equation.  I mean, that movie has lines like:<blockquote><i>"That's right! Ice... man. I am dangerous. "

"You can be my wingman any time."

"Too close for missiles, I'm switching to guns."

"You stink!"

"Splash that sucker, yeah! "

"Great balls of fire! "</i></blockquote>Uhhh... I think there's something wrong with me...
