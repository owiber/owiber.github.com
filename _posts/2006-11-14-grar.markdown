Stupid coughing made me not have a very good night's rest and everyone knows Oliver needs sleep (though, not so much any more, haha).  I got some soup from Olivia's (thanks Mommy =), and that helped a bit I think.  Tonight, I must remember to bring a bottle of water upstairs... meh, now I feel a bit grouchy, but that's nothing a little horrible music can't fix...

Doesn't that song just make you want to bob your head up and down? lol...
