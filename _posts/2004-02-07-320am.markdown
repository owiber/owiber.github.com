Paul and I are sitting in my dorm right now and Sam is taking a girl home (ooooOoOoOoOhhh Saaammm... ;).  We just finished a great midnight/early morning feast at San Jacinto.  We had apple pie, pumpkin pie, honey mesquite chicken, milk, Dr.Pepper, whipped cream, and... uhh.. yeah, it was a lot of fun. Richie even brought down Mr.Hedgehog.<br /><br />K, I need to go home now. Tata!<br /><br />-Oliver
