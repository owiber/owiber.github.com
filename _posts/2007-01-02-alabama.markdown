The trip to Alabama was pretty decent, although I probably won't even do that again anytime soon.  I drove pretty much the entire way there in one day (around 12ish hours I think).  The wedding was small, but not bad, I wasn't bored... which seems common at weddings from what I hear?  I don't think I get bored because I'm always trying to take pictures and/or waiting for the next moment I <i>need</i> to capture.

I was pretty happy with the shots I took this time around, I haven't had a good photo-op in a while.  I don't do well with posed shots; candids are more my thing, and weddings provide ample opportunities for that.  Here're some of my favorites:

This one's a bit blurry, which makes me sad, cause I really liked the composition with the groom in the background... =(
