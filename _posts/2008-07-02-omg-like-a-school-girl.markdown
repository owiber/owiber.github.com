I cannot believe it actually happened.  Every since the FIRST Guitar Hero came out, I have wanted this to happen.  I even made a post on the official forums (which I can no longer find...) adding this to the song request thread.  Mark and I even contemplated writing our own PC version so we could make this happen (our PS2 to USB controller converter didn't work which foiled our plans... haha).

Anyways, it is now done.  I can die in peace. ;)
