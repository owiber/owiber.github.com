So Chronicles of Narnia was pretty good, pretty happy with that. =)

Andrew is back!  And apparently is no longer single. O_o Haha... congrats, buddy.  I, in the mean time, will continue waiting around I suppose... lol.

Went to do community service at the Salvation Army "today" (Friday), and we helped sort a whole ton of toys.  There was one HUGE remote control Hummer that I'm sure is going to make some little kid very happy.  I hope he doesn't have a baby sibling or it might get run over.

Watching the Superman Returns treaser trailer has become a daily ritual.  Still makes me smile each time I watch it...

I hear it's finals time around UT. Hehe, gluck to all you kiddos taking tests. =)

A day or so ago before I went upstairs, I paused for a few minutes and just stared at the dark room lined with our computers.  Ahhh... fun times we've had here, will be sad to move out next semester (but necessary, I think =).

More later... maybe, haha.
