In a week or so I will be transitioning to a new position at Bazaarvoice - <a href="http://www.bazaarvoice.com/services/innovation">Labs Engineer</a>.  I'm really excited to face a new set of challenges/problems and am comfortable that there are more than capable engineers in Technical Services to fill in for me. I have no doubt that the team that has been built there will continue to push the boundaries on delivering our products and I hope to be able to help from the other side of the building. =)

I took the job switch as an opportunity to update my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/owiber">LinkedIn</a> with a slightly better job history at Bazaarvoice, lest I forget what I did... haha.  I also updated my Twitter avatar and I think I need to make a new custom background, but I haven't decided on what to do yet...
