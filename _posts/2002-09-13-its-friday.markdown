The week is <i>done!</i> w00t =)<br /><br />Now... gotta take a shower and turn in CS336 homework, then weekend time! =)<br /><br />So, I think I'm gonna get a new wireless AP cause the one I have right now is not the bomb... probably will get a "cheap" $80ish d-link one... unless if anyone else has any suggestions or negative comments regarding the d-link...<br /><br />I think Van got that one though and it's been working well?<br /><br />I've been surprised by my abilities to wake up on time these past few weeks... I even get up before my alarm clock goes off sometimes! Perhaps it's the re-aquirement of a regular sleep pattern... =)<br /><br />-Oliver
