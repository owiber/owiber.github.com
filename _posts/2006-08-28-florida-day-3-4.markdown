Yesterday, we went to church and then did a bunch of nothing to recooperate from the Busch Gardens and beach trips the prior two days.  Had nice mid-day naps. Yaaaay!  Then we watched The New World, which was a horrible waste of time and Flightplan, which was less so.

I don't even really know if I have any pictures or videos from yesterday worth mentioning... I might scrounge up the flash cards and see later though.  Speaking of which, I uploaded <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157594253941893/">pictures from Busch Gardens</a> yesterday.

Anyways, back in Austin now and I am ready to take a long nap.  Thanks to Andrew, Jen, and all the other Floridians that hung out with us while we were there, had a great time!
