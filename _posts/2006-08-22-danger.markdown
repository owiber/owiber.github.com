I took Kathy to Town Lake to run with me (well, kinda... I left her behind a few times =) and showed her where I hopped into the water to take the "shortcut."  She points and says "you went through poison ivy?"  And yes, apparently, I did.  Despite the little warning tags on vines along the trail which clearly state "POISON IVY," I just went right on through and swam across. Haha... man, I am hardcore!  uhhh... just kidding. =)

After running, I came back to my apartment to my sister and her friends having a BBQ and got some steak and chicken from them.  Mmmm... thanks. =)

I looked at my PTO today and I will apparently accrue nearly two weeks of vacation between now and January (not including what I've already accrued).  I've got about a week right now, which I'll be using most of for the trip to Florida... but now I might take an extra day (maybe this Wednesday) if I get my work done tomorrow.  Maybe I can use that time to work on the Vox Veniae website which is going to be quite rushed......
