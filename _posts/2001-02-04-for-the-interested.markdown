If you wanna see the website that got Van, Chad and I first place at the BPA Regional Tournament (and is sending us to State), you can <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/temp/website>click here</a>. Eh... you may... *cough* recognize *cough* the... erhm, design *cough* from something you've eh... *cough* seen before. *cough* =) We tried making a design of it's own, but all the things Van and I could come up with weren't as good... so... well... <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/temp/website>yeah</a> we ripped off the design...<br /><br /><font size=1>*Note: Due to a cookie issue thingy-ma-bobber, the shopping cart thing on the BPA site won't work if you logged onto OliverWEB then tried to use it. It will always say you have nothing in your shopping cart. If you want to test it out, close your browser (<i>all</i> browser windows actually - to log off of OliverWEB) then go to: <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/temp/website>http://www.oliverweb.com/temp/website</a>.</font><br /><br />-Oliver
