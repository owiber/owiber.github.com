Yesterday, I was playing with my camera in my room trying to take pictures of myself (which is a little harder than it seems, sometimes, haha) and this was the only one I think turned out ok.  I'm getting a little shaggy... haha.

I heard music coming from across the hall and poked my head in.  Wes has gifted me with a "tune" now that he is supposed to play whenever I enter the room.  Sweet!

Chad and Nancy were also there listening to Wes...

And then later, we had a little chat session in Van and I's room.  Here is Sam in all his glory (well, ok... not <i>all</i>):

And the night wouldn't be complete without some hot Indian action:

This picture looks like I was beheaded...
