Well....I have some art for you peeps to see.  I haven't put them up on coconut comics...mostly cause I haven't sent Matt a layout or anything, so I thought I would show you.  I just got a scanner, so I've scanned them.  Yeah, they're wierd, but you'll have to get over that...<br />  <br /><a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/Tongueo.jpg">Sky Tongue</a><br /><a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/Lab Safety.jpg">Lab Safety</a><br /><a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/SnakeGun.jpg">The Wierdest Dream</a><br /><br />-Wes
