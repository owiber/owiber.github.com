Everyone should come to the Musical that the McNeil group is putting on.  It is called Working and although it is homosexual and patriotic...if you don't believe me on those... ask anyone related to the musical in any way... except for Dye or chipper little girls... <br />Anyway, it is January 23-26 which is Wed-Saturday just in case you were wondering... I don't know how much it costs though.  But come for love, devotion, and free food. (Love, devotion, and free food not guaranteed.)  Oh and keep checking Mr.Techhappy, cuz something may have just popped up since the last time you went there!<br /><br />-Brook
