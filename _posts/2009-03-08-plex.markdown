I got a new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a> and installed <a href="http://www.plexapp.com/">Plex</a> on it which has been pretty nifty.  I don't like its music playback as much as Front Row (which is a bit sad because Front Row is a bit lacking there too), but it's overall more capable than it despite being a bit less stable for the time being.  Seems like there's a lot of development for it, so it'll likely improve rapidly.

I also FINALLY upgraded my Wordpress install after doing a recent brand new install at work.  Seems like they've been busy as well... =)

I think I've moved the last of my stuff from the apartment, so I'm "officially" moved out.  I still can't find a few things though... like the charging station for my hand-held vacuum (which would come in handy).  Andrew was kind enough to clean off all the shelves I had there and set it all by the door.  I'll have to write another <a href="http://www.andrewapproved.com">Andrew Approved</a> post to thank him. =)

There'll be no place to run
When your caught within the grip
