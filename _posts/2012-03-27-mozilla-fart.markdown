Mozilla just farted in his sleep. =(

Here's a set of tweets that makes me smile (it's from newest to oldest, so you probably want to read it in reverse).

My 5D Mark III comes in tomorrow! YEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!

I asked the social networks whether or not it was weird that I sometimes like going to the movies by myself. I got a number of responses that seemed to indicate that that is not one of the reasons that makes me weird. I haven't gone in a while by myself, but it does feel appealing occasionally. I never really got why movie-going was viewed as such a social event, since you don't really interact while watching the movie. There are certainly some exceptions (like watching Expendables next to OMan - that makes the movie uber awesome), but it seems most people viewed going alone sometimes positively.

I posted a few pics from Andrew and Jen's engagement party thing to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157629312019558/">flickr</a>. I wasn't really out to document the entire event (there were plenty of other photographers there), so I just have a few random ones. I wish I had actually taken at least one picture of Jen though (sorry!). Here're a few and some of the after-party:
