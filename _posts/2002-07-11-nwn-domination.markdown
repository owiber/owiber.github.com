Well, I beat it. Here's a few of my comments on the last chapter...<br /><br />I'm a bit disappointed by how easy it was... I think that perhaps I became TOO powerful of a wizard cause my battle with two giant dragons lasted a mere 30 seconds tops (they couldn't withstand many 120+ point chain lightnings =)... and after I figured out how to beat the last boss, that fight took even less time...<br /><br />The fight with the two dragons was in a cave with LOTS of open space... I think that was supposed to be used to run around to avoid the dragons... but ummm... I barely moved at all... I wish they would have adjusted the dragon's strengths/weaknesses to offer the most challenge to a certain player-type... I'm sure people who require melee combat would have a much harder time, but since I can do massive amounts of damage from afar... it was quite an easy task.<br /><br />The ending is pretty anti-climatic I think and I would have liked them to have put some time into a CG rendered FMV scene at the end to reward the player for HOURS of play-time but alas... they didn't.<br /><br />So... I'm done with a majority of my NWN fun, although I plan on playing through at least a little bit of the single player again to refine my character a little bit more (primarily to bring him over to Good, rather than Neutral)...<br /><br />And Brook, I have found a way to defeat your super spell-resitance! ;)<br /><br />And Sean, I don't care what you think. I don't care if you (and others =) have no clue what I'm talking about. I can say anything I want here. ;)<br /><br />-Oliver
