This weekend, I went up to Dallas to visit my sister, celebrate father's day/my dad's birthday, and to watch Wicked.  Wicked was pretty entertaining.  I had previously read the story on wikipedia, but I don't think that ruined it for me. =p

I recently got the remaining batch of photos for my room which I would consider pretty much done at this point.  I've finally finished replacing all of my pre-house furniture (aka old/cheap college stuff) with new stuff so it actually looks decent now.  I'll come back and post pics!

I've also developed a cough that is no fun at night. =(  I think it's allergy related, but for now, cough drops are sufficing...

I reserved an iPhone 4 at The Domain, but the line apparently has been 3+ hours for the entire day, so I think I'm going to hold off on getting one until it becomes more reasonably obtainable.  Plus, I hear if you hold it wrong it drops your calls. =p

Oh, and I did a little work on the <a href="http://samitic.us">Sam Ni fan site</a>. =)
