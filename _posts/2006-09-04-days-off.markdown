I tend to waste my days off by sleeping in late.  I tried to wake up today at 10:30ish after going to sleep at 5AM, but that didn't work out so well.  Ended up waking up at 1something.  Oh well.

I slept on the couch downstairs again last night.  Man, that thing is comfy.  It's so much better than my bed (which reminds me, I need to get some of that foam stuff that will probably make it better).  I like taking two pillows, one for my head and one to hug and falling asleep like that.  I don't know why I like it, but I do, haha.  Maybe it's because I've gotten used to couches cause I regularly sleep on the couch instead of a bed when I go home home.  *shrug*  Beds are so... boring. ;)
