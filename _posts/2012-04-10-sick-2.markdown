I caught something last night, apparently, so now I'm all congested and I have a sore throat. =( These past few weeks have not been kind to my nose (allergies + cold).

On Thursday night, Andrew and Viraj came in to town for their three-day weekend. We went to Papa Tino's, which was pretty good but the lighting was really dark. I wouldn't really have gotten much with my Mark II, but the Mark III at 12800 ISO let me get these:

Certainly noisy, but not bad! I'm pretty pleased. These pics have more detail than I could make out with my eyes in that lighting.

And... here are some more Mozilla pics for your viewing pleasure. First, some Facebook timline fun. =)

I've got some shots of Mozilla and Ally playing in the grass, but I forgot to upload them to Flickr. Another time. =)

On Saturday, we played some frisbee game that involved two rectangular areas:

Viraj, at one point, called a disc out of bounds and reasoned "based on the line from that <em>one</em> cone, it's out." Apparently Viraj has redefined what makes a line and one can now be defined based on one point. The disc was in, it turns out.

I finished Catching Fire, and Mockingjay, the second and third books of the Hunger Games trilogy. I enjoyed Catching Fire quite a bit and it was certainly the best of the three (Hunger Games, I thought was mediocre). Mockingjay was probably somewhere in the middle, but I didn't find the ending all that appealing. It felt awkward to me. Maybe the whole series was overhyped for me, but I felt a bit let-down by the ending. I've found that I've been enjoying books with complexity in not only plot but how the story's told. I know Hunger Games is a "young adult" series, so that's probably why it didn't live up to my impression of the hype, but I thought the first and third books were a bit too.. simple I guess.

In related news, Harry Potter is now available in e-book formats (legit), so I've purchased the series and will start to read them. I kind of lost interest in the Dark Tower series (I'm somewhere in the middle of the third book I think), but maybe I'll come back and finish that one day too. Guess all these books should come in handle tomorrow while I'm sitting at home recuperating...

Night!
