I feel like this week has been hectic.  Some days you feel always busy and then you think back on what you did and you have no idea... I think that was a lot of this week.  Tomorrow's Friday, though!

After a bit of conversation with coworkers, I picked up lamely-named Scrabble rip-off, Words with Friends and have been playing it somewhat heavily the entire week.  If you happen to pick it up, you can guess what my username is. ;)  I've only finished a few games, including some that make Brook look like he's a glutton for punishment.

I think I've got a bit of shin splint action going on, but I'm looking forward to ultimate this weekend anyways.  We should have a pretty decent crew out this time, I'm hoping.

Here's to the weekend!
