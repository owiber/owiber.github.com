So Van, Viraj and I went down to San Antonio to visit Nancy.  Today we spent most of the day lounging around and making food... we made a pie for Avani and then went to her birthday dinner.  Unfortunately, Viraj did not manage to get his mack on and score an eligible Indian hottie, but maybe next time, bud.

I'm gonna go smash my face into a pillow now, adios!
