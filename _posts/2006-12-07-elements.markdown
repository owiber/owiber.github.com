Spent pretty much all yesterday evening/night with my Elements working on some appreciation/thank you gifts.  I'm not going to say to who or whatever yet because it's a surprise (sssshhh!)... but they should be delivered today, and I'll post some pics of the event after I process the pics from my camera (maybe tonight or tomorrow?).   Essence was there the entire time and didn't really do much except take about three hours to get us a pizza, haha.  It's ok though, cause it wasn't entirely his fault I suppose and it ended up being free.

Ummm... guess I'll just wait for the pics to talk more about that. =p  Thanks to Olivia and Stephanie for letting us use your place for so long. =)
