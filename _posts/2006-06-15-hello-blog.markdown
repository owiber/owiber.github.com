Boo!  Ok, so I've taken a long hiatus away from blogging.  Mostly because I didn't have anything blog worthy to talk about (or the blog wasn't worthy of receiving what I wanted to talk about. =)

There are lots of interesting tid bits I learn at work that would make great blog entries, but I'd be violating so many contracts and laws, I don't think it'd bode well for me.  So... um... work is interesting. ;)

Yesterday, Andrew and I installed an aux audio input into my car.  Unfortunately, I left my iPod at work and didn't really have a good way to test it other than a cruddy old Sony CD player.  I think something happened and the wire got loose cause now I only get audio from the right speakers.  Doh... gotta crack open the center console again...
