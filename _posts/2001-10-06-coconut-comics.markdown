Yeah yeah, I know I post about this a whole heck of a lot, ahwell.  Anyway, check out the <a href = "http://www.coconutcomics.com">page!</a>  This isn't the end layout I'm thinking... for a few reasons...<br /><br />1) Don't know if Brook wants his comic associated with CC or not... nor do I know if that's his real title =) Let me know!<br /><br />2) Cat, still interested in doing comics?  =)  You should<br /><br />3) Chad... Hope you're interested in doing yours still =)<br /><br />and 4) How do the URL's look to everyone?  Wes do you want yours changed or are those ok?  Oliver do you want MrTechHappy to have its own domain or link to www.mrtechhappy.com?  and Brook, if willing to have comic on CC do you want it to stay on Geocities page, or do you want a directory on CC's?<br /><br />lastly, if you want an email address at coconutcomics to forward to you, let me know what address you want, and what address you want it to forward to.<br /><br />ie: <i> Wes@coconutcomics.com forwards to wretchedkat@whatever.com </i><br /><br />-Minix
