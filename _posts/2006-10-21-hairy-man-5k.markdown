Yay! Finished the Hairy Man 5k this morning with Kathy and Van.  I did better than I was expecting and I think I could have even done it a bit faster, especially if I didn't have my shin to worry about.  I was a bit worried on how I would handle the run since I took over a week off of running.  I think the what's-it-ma-called I got to wrap around my calf/shin helped a lot... and the weather was awesome for running.

Anyways, don't think I banged up my shin too badly... it was nice to run again. =)

A coworker asked me if I knew of any haunted haystack rides, and I had no idea what they were when he asked.  On the way out of the Hairy Man 5k, I saw a sign for one though.  What is it?  Is it just you ride on the back of a truck with haystacks, go down a trail and "haunted" stuff attack you?
