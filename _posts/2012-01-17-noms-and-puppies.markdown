This was a good weekend.

To celebrate Oriana and my mom's birthdays, we went to Uchiko on Saturday. They were 30 minutes late seating us, but definitely made up for it by either being extremely generous with a single omakase order (usually meant for a pair, but four of us were fed) or giving us one for free. Then they also threw in an appetizer or two and extra fried milk desserts which is probably my favorite dessert second only to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/5437358813/in/set-72157625903525441/">craziness that is Alinea</a>. I think that experience has cemented Uchiko as my favorite restaurant in Austin.

Earlier that day, I took Mozilla over to meet Syndey where he chased her around the yard (she was kind of scared of him) until she threw up. Sydney is  a big lab, so it was fairly comical.

On Sunday, I hooked up with the owners of one of Mozilla's brothers, Texas, who just so happens is also in Austin. They came over and the puppies played for quite a while:
