I'm in linguistics... I think I need more sleep (even though I got like seven hours of sleep last night). I'm feeling the stress of many aeons upon my shoulders! Hehe, I actually just wanted to use the word "aeons"... it looks cool. Aye, tonight I gotta do a lot of web stuff, grade a bunch of assignments then... hmmm... then I guess I can rest. Might try to hit bed a little sooner tonight.

Man, WarCraft3 DOTA games are hot though. Some highlights from last night:<ul><li>Van (with invisibility) and my wind walking crazy ranged guy sneaking up behind Sam and Paul and swiftly taking them out.</li><li>Sam yelling out "I'm leaving the demon edge by the acolyte."</li><li>My hearing Sam's previous comment and wind walking to the location and "stealing" the demon edge. =)</li></ul>Oh the hotness... I think we're addicted.  Oh yeah, enjoy the random rodent pic.
