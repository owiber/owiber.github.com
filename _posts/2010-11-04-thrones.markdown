Oops, I just realized I didn't make my obligatory weekend update post.  Well...
<ul>
<li>We played ultimate again and it was splendid weather and had some new comers that were pretty good.  Enjoyable!  My shins feel a little sore now though... recovering...</li>
<li>Didn't do much for Halloween... for work, my team was Office Space themed, but I forgot to bring my camera, so I don't have photos.  If I get unlazy, I may track down some shots other people took...</li>
<li>Watched UT lose to Baylor.  Good.  They deserved it.  We should not be nervous our guy can't catch the ball on kick-returns.  I swear, I probably watched UT botch this <em>at least once every game</em> I've watched this season.</li>
<li>I finished <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, but I'm not sure I'll continue with the series... we'll see.  So far, I've read about five or six books that start series but have not yet read the next yet.  I guess I'm kind of noncommittal.</li>
</ul>
