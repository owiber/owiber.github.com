This month, I started at <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>! I'm currently in the middle of a three week stint in San Francisco. The scent of piss is not uncommon here, but the city is very nostalgic for me, so I guess that at least evens things out, haha. I'm enjoying my time here, but I miss my Mozilla. On the plus side, I'm really excited to work with my new teammates and Stripe has great food (breakfast, lunch, and dinner!).

Last weekend, I strolled on over to Chinatown and found that unsurprisingly Golden Gate Bakery was on vacation. My hit rate is probably around 50/50 now, or perhaps a little worse. I debated bringing my camera on this trip, and ended up doing so, but I have yet to take it out of my bag. I'm going to San Diego at the end of the month with my new Stripe team, so perhaps I'll put it to some use there.

Before starting at Stripe, I had roughly a month off. I did a lot of bumming around, playing some Minecraft, and went to Los Angeles and New Orleans. LA featured the debut of this video:

and resulted in this one:

I've got a bunch of random clips of Sam from NOLA where we tried really hard to make him out to be a racist, but I'm not sure what I have gels well, so it may not end up anywhere. I did, however, rummage through a lot of old media and came out with this:
