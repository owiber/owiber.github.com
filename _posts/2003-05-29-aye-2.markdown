Ugh... ACC + work is so tiring, even if the work itself isn't tough... I got home tonight and man... I feel drained. I even fell asleep in class for a while (which did give me a temporary boost).<br /><br />So I just realized that I really should make another Friends page this summer... but I have so many other websites to do, I'll be lucky if I can get to that.  Hmm... well, if I get inspired, it'll happen... otherwise... =/<br /><br />-Oliver
