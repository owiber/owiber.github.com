Well, it's 5AM right now and I should be sleeping soon.  Origon (or however you spell his name =) is sleeping on my bed and he's snoring.  It's kinda funny.<br /><br />Was looking at trailers and noticed that Passion (now named The Passion of the Christ?) is coming out February 25th.  I'm looking forward to seeing that.<br /><br />Ummm... k, that's it for now. I'm supposed to have a meeting with Karen about Liquid website "tomorrow" (later today), so I really should be sleeping.  Night!<br /><br />-Oliver
