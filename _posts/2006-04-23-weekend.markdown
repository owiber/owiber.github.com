<br />So yesterday, was Julie and Nancy's "party" thing at our place, which you can view pics from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72057594113649863/">here</a>.  Today, I woke up "early" considering I went to sleep at 7AM, haha... and had a pretty relaxing day.<br />
Went to the Arboretum to meet up with Olivia and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72057594114298760/">shot some pictures</a>.  Then had dinner with Chancy and Nancy's uncle at Fresh Choice.<br />
We'll be moving out of the apartment by the end of the next month, so that'll be interesting. I don't think anyone has any set plans on where they're moving to, so that'll be even <i>more</i> interesting, haha.  I will probably be moving to Olivia's apartment for at least a while until I figure out a more permanent place to reside (thanks Stephanie &amp; Olivia!).  I'm actually kinda looking forward to that. =)<br />
The more I shoot with this 85 f/1.2L, the more I feel like I'm cheating myself by restricting it to the 1.6x crop factor body... 5D?.........
