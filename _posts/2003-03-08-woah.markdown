Aye, I need to update!... well it seems as if Mark and I are going to have pass/fail linguistics cause his quiz and test were uber-hard. I would throw a certain simile in there courtesy of Viraj, <a href=http://www.baghat.com>Mr.Baghat</a>, but I like to keep OliverWEB "PG." =)<br /><br />I am looking forward to a nice spring break... full of team games of C&C:Generals with Van. Oh yeah, and before I forget, happy birthday to Chad (Saturday) and Minix (Sunday). I hope I got those days right. =) I gotta make sure I go get new contacts and attempt to fix up the Town Car.<br /><br />-Oliver
