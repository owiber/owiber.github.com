(Hehehe... j/j guys =).<br /><br />I've added 3 more pages to the <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/index.shtml">Pics</a> section (5 pics per page this time, rather than the usual 4, <i>ooooooohh aaaaaaaahh</i> =). This time, they're pics from Van and I's trip to Plano for the BPA State competition (4th place at web developement team! -Website can be found on <a href="http://www.roundrockisd.org/mcneil">McNeil's website</a> - <a href="http://www.roundrockisd.org/mcneil/bpa/index.html">here</a>). <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/26/index.shtml">The first page</a> of the new pages.<br /><br />-Oliver
