The list of Systems/games I own, starting with the earliest:<br /><br />Super Nintendo(Starfox, Super Mario World, Primal Rage, Mariokart, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 4, Earthworm Jim 2)<br /><br />Sega Genesis(Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Road Rash 2, Comix Zone)<br /><br />Nintendo Virtual Boy(Mario's Tennis)<br /><br />Nintendo 64(Killer Instinct Gold, Zelda 64, NFL Blitz, NHL 99, Banjo Kazooie, Turok: the Dinosaur Hunter)<br /><br />Sega Dreamcast(Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Soul Reaver, Sonic Adventure, Iron Aces, Resident Evil:  Code Veronica, Vigilante 8: Second Offense, Crazy Taxi, Armada, Sword of the Berzerk: Guts Rage, F355 Challenge, and a bunch more that I can't remember right now.  Some of those are also my cousin's games that he left here a long time ago, and hasn't asked for them back)<br /><br />Nintendo Gameboy Advance(Super Mario Advance, MarioKart: Super Circuit, F-14 Tomcat, Advance Wars, Sonic Advance, Robocop 2)<br /><br />Nintendo GameCube(Rogue Squadron 2:  Rogue Leader, Pikmin, Super Smash Bros.  Melee)<br /><br />And I'll go ahead and list computer games, not counting my emulators and ROMS, which is extensive:  X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, MYST, Sim City 2000, Starcraft and Brood War, Duke Nukem 3D, and plenty of demos and whatnot.  Can't have any new games right now, though, due to the crappy nature of this computer. =(<br /><br />And that is all...I think.  Couldn't remember all the dreamcast games, because I kinda just bought tons of used games pretty cheap, so yeah...<br /><br />-Wes
