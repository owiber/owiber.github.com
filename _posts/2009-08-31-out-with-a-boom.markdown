I've had this discussion with a couple friends before, and although perhaps a bit disturbing, it's a fun thought.  The basic premise is "if you're really old, like 105, and you're about to die, how would you take yourself out?"  I believe Viraj's answer was he wanted to rent a Lamborghini and drive off a cliff at like 100something MPH.  Mine?  I want to blow up on top of the Round Rock <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Round_Rock_of_Round_Rock_Texas.jpg">round rock</a>, taking it out with me.  I find it immensely humorous to become infamous by taking out a small town landmark/namesake.  Anyways, it's just a make-believe scenario... please don't have me arrested. =p
