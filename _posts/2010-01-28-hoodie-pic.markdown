I took the picture at the end of this post while I was at work listening to people talk.  The hoodie makes me feel like I'm secret. Safe.  Haha, just kidding, but I felt like I had to write a blog post so I could use it, so... here it is.

Apparently Apple released their iPad, which I've known was being worked on for quite some time from a previous employer.  Took long enough!  I'm mostly disappointed there's no multitasking.  A little anti-climactic as it's basically just a big iPod Touch that you can add 3G to for an extra $130.  I'd categorize it as "neat toy" but not "must have gadget."  At least, not yet.

My little sister told me to get the Scramble 2 iPhone/iPod app, which I did.  I have discovered that I am not very good at it and she mocks me with her high score that is significantly higher than mine.
