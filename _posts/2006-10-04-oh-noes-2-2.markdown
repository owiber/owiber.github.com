Lost S3 starts tonight, but I will be leading my Elements, so I will not be able to watch. =(  I suppose that's why we have a DVR... you guys better record it, haha.

I didn't even realize that the UT/OU game was this weekend until a day or so ago.  Usually I feel some kind of buzz of its coming, but not this year... maybe cause both teams aren't as good or because I'm not as close to UT?  *shrug* dunno. =)

Some other stuff I might blog about in a password-protected post soon.  We'll see... haha. ;)

Oh yes, and congrats to Andrew and his Freescale offer. =)  (I hope I'm allowed to say that... lol)

hulking monstrosity
too late to get out now
And like the speed of sound
this thing has brought me down
I don't remember how
I want to be free
but Juggernaut is killing me

Freedom like a song
The weak shall be made strong
I may sink before I swim
but I'm not giving in to you" - Five Iron Frenzy</blockquote>
