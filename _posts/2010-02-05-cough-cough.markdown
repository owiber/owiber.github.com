I'm quite disappointed that I managed to get sick on my way to Seattle, but other than that the trip was overall pleasant.    My immune system has plummeted in recent years it seems... that, or I expose myself to riskier conditions... who knows.

Tomorrow (or rather, later today) is our quarterly All-Hands at the Drafthouse.  This will likely be the last time it's at the Drafthouse as we've grown too large for it. =(

Here's hoping this annoying cough goes away...
