So I'm making this weekend post late. Blablabla... =p

I felt like the weekend went by pretty fast this time, probably because I went to sleep really late (or rather, really early in the morning) on Saturday and woke up at around 3:30PM.  I started hacking through video from the Key West trip and ended up with the following, which you should probably not watch if you are easily offended. ;)

I decided to register <a href="http://samitic.us">Samitic.us</a> for similar antics in the future (I have a few plans...), but for now it's relatively bare.  I think I finished the night by watching Running Man at Chancy's, but I also might have my days mixed up... this is probably why I should blog about the weekend sooner. =p

On Sunday, I went to Vox and they had some baptisms.  I took some photos, but I haven't processed them yet (soon, I promise!).  After that, we got BBQ from a school bus (it was called Old School BBQ, har har) then I went home and napped for a while.  I don't remember what I did after that...
