Do you all remember the old <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/boredom2/sheep/index.html">sheep</a> program that was featured on Oliverweb?  It was awhile ago... well I was looking at that program the other day, and I started thinking "You know what?  I could probably do something like that" I mentioned this to Olivia, and decided she should be the character walking around the desktop.  I started to work on it.  Lala, here is some preliminary (and sucky =)) art of Olivia walking =)  <br /><center><br /><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/lalabad.gif"><br /></center><br /><br />Seems to be walking really quickly huh?  Well thats because the shareware anim-gif creator I downloaded, had no delay option... and I was too lazy to go find another one, in the program, I'll be able to slow it down very easily, and it will look tons better =)<br /><br />I just want to say something to Oliver now =)  <br /><br /><center><i>bite me =)</i></center><br /><br />If anyones curious, thats my response to him, before he gives me another <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/chats/om6.shtml">"melody minix"</a> comment =)<br /><br />I'm trying to think of some things for her to do, like the sheep would whimper, eat flowers, etc.  Please give suggestions =)  Also, I'm trying to decide if I should make her, fall towards the bottom of the screen, like a gravity thing, or if I should allow her to walk around the desktop, as if it were a flat surface, please, give me feedback!<br /><br />-Minix
