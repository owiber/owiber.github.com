After looking at pictures <a href="http://www.xanga.com/item.aspx?user=chix0rgirl&amp;tab=weblogs&amp;uid=248754527">Kathy</a> took, we had a great sense of deja-vu...

THEN!! We realized we took uncanny similar photos the weekend previously! One of them, we even took a full year+ in advance! SHAME SHAME ON THIS BLATANT THIEVERY!!!
