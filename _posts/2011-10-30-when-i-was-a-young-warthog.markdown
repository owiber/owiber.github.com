Last night, Sam, Mark and I scoured YouTube and watched old 80's/90's cartoon themes.  I brought up the fact that all of the following were cartoons I used to watch.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oln_448CFnk">Poochie</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqJtEyxHhkA">Rainbow Brite</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFE5XKCeVI">Popples</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu6Ul7Daxk4">Strawberry Shortcake</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNqrWm1M3Sc">Jem</a></li>
</ul>
Sam and Mark didn't seem very surprised at this reveal. Granted, I also watched a lot of others (TMNT, Transformers, Voltron, etc.).  After watching all of those intros, there's an awful lot of pink going on... =D

All of this reminded me of a memory I have of when I was kid.  My dad presented two packages of cartoon-branded candy to me.  I don't remember what one of them was, but the other was Jem branded.  Guess which one I took?  When my dad asked me if I was sure and shouldn't I want the other one, I just shook my head and walked off with the Jem pack.  That's where my memory ends, but I'm sure Olivia was left with some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0BzBFWt8V8">MASK</a> candy or something like that...
