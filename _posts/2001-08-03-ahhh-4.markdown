It was brought to my attention that bitmaps (BMP) were used as image formats for some images. DO NOT USE BITMAPS!!! =) <br /><br />Also, in the process of converting the bitmaps to JPEG and uploading them, I noticed a bunch of images that were just sitting there not being used. Please don't use the newsimages folder as a storage space. At least tell me if you put something in there temporarily so I can delete it...<br /><br />And Minix, what program are you using to save JPEG's? They're bigger than they need to be... (file size wise =)<br /><br />-Oliver
