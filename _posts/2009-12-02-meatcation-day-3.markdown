Mark and I started the day off by eating bacon with oatmeal we slow cooked the entire night (we got oats from Whole Foods, not that instant stuff =).

Then, we smoked salmon for lunch:

And had some mangoes with that:

Then, we (by we, I mean mostly Mark and Andrew) went totally awesome on ribs, despite the rain causing a lot of havoc on maintaining the appropriate temperature in the smoker.  Despite that, they turned out pretty great:

And... we wrapped up the meal with peas:

Tomorrow, bacon of the elements (bacon, scallops, duck) for dinner and some undetermined whole fish for lunch.
