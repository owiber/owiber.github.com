This one's for Kathy because she bugs me that my blog is boring (it is =p), and I have nothing else to do at the moment. =)

I don't know why I was never really into music in my middle-years (I think I really liked it when I was really small... I have scars to prove it probably =), but I apparently like it a lot now.  I think listening to songs is closely tied to emotions that conjure up while listening to those songs... so maybe I just didn't have enough experiences under my belt until this point to appreciate music.  Sometimes I find myself wanting to wander out into some random grassy area, lay on the ground staring into a starry sky and just listen to the many random tunes on my <strike>iPod</strike> portable music player (I'm not an Apple fanboy ;).  I like songs that remind me of middle school, when I was a short dweeby fellow and make me laugh at how horrible I looked.  There are songs that are so dramatic, they're funny and remind me of how people can be such drama-whores sometimes, heh... they make me laugh too. =)

Then, sometimes, there are those songs that are like prayers that make you realize how much you need God... *sigh*... I need to find that grassy field... =)

Oh yeah, I'm looking for a good digital camera (point and shoot) for times when bringing a DSLR is just not practical... I'm really interested in one that records video into a format that isn't retarded (i.e. Quicktime's Motion JPEG) and sucks up a 1GB CF card in 10 minutes.  I haven't been able to find many good ones that encode into MPEG4... guess I'll have to wait a few months...
