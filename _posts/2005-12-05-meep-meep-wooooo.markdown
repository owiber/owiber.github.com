So last week I discovered myself on the <a href="http://www.freescale.com">Freescale</a> website as an <a>employee testimony</a> in their students section.  Somehow I managed to write the most out of all the people on there... and I thought I was on the short side. *shrug* =)  That bit about culture is, honestly, a lot of BS, cause I really don't know how to describe the "culture of a company" whatever that is.  Oh yeah, the "say hi to people in the halls" part is an allusion to something from my first week at Freescale (as an ERP)... but I tire and don't feel like explaining the whole thing. =)

In other news, Chronicles of Narnia comes out later this week.  I found out Oriana has sneak preview tickets for Thursday.  I think I will run her over with my car and take them.  Watch your back! &gt;=]

And this is for Andrew:

I WUV DA WITTLE WABBITS WHEN DEY EAT WITTLE WUFFINS!!!

Edit:

So if scheming to murder my own blood does not clearly depict how excited I am about the Chronicles of Narnia movie, I will also let it be known that when I went home this weekend, I picked up The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and read it in one sitting.  Not that that is much of an accomplishment itself (it's a fairly short and easy read), but I, like Brook would put it, <i>don't read</i>.  So, if you can think about how someone who doesn't read reads a book in one sitting, then maybe you can grasp how excited I am about this movie.

For Aslan!!
