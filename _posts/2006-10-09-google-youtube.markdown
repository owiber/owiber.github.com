So, <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> buys <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>, eh?  I was kinda hoping <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> would buy it.  I've kinda been rooting for the underdog search engine for a while (even though I don't use it) out of my fondness of <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> and general positive attitude for <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>.

Oh... I'm hungry, that's all I'm going to say for now... must find food...

Edit:  My shin is still hurting.  It's alright until a mile or so, after that it starts to hurt a decent amount with every step.  I wonder when it will go away... I want to run a 5k. =(

Oh yeah, and I feel really sorry for <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=cAlgil_iyyc">this kid</a>. Haha... that guy is going to be made fun of for a while.

On the phone?
Do you know what it feels like
Being alone?
I'll find someone new

Swing, swing, swing
From the tangles of
My heart is crushed By a former love
Can you help me find a way
To carry on again?" - All-American Rejects</blockquote>
