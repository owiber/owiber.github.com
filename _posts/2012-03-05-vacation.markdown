I'm in Hawaii! Today, I plan on not doing much at all. =)

I'll post pics and videos later (though you can probably find a decent amount of pics on Facebook/Flickr). For now, I will leave you this:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/6953386389/" title=":D by owiber, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7051/6953386389_86bc4a76d1.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt=":D"></a>

Also, Oriana told me a while ago she threw away the copy of Twilight I got her from London (so what if it was infected with glitter?!). I am very disappointed, so I think I will be giving her some more copies from airports around the world...
