Ah, the Red River Shootout.  The UT/OU game is the only game I've <em>ever</em> been to, and the year I went, UT lost 12-0, so I have yet to see UT actually score in person.  *shrug* =)

On the plus side, this weekend we watched the game at my place and made lots of yummy food (I only have picture of corn, but we made burgers and steak too):

I also got some remote controls for my Alien Bees, so I tested them out a bit with one light.  Sam, graciously, decided to be my model (perhaps not too graceful for you):

Speaking of Viraj, he tried to pull some lame germophobic move and decided to waste a tissue by putting it under his cell phone on the ground.

Mark alerted me of this fact, and I would have none of it, so we had to fix it:
