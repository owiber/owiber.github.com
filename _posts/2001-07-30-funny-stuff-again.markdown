i had this conversation with Grace, it's like the Penny-Arcades, very funny i thought.<br /><br />Nosliwc156: have you ever played Counter-Strike? <br /> Nosliwc156: sigh.... <br /> AngeLuve16: haha, harvey plays it <br /> AngeLuve16: I hate it <br /> Nosliwc156: it rocks a monkey <br /> Nosliwc156: does Harvey have an AIM name/ <br /> Nosliwc156: ? <br /> AngeLuve16: cause he'll sit there and play while I'm at his house =( <br /> AngeLuve16: no, he doesn't use AIM <br /> Nosliwc156: lol, it is that enthralling <br /> Nosliwc156: what a shame <br /> Nosliwc156: it IS a great game though <br /> AngeLuve16: he at least got smart and turned the volume down when we're on the phone <br /> Nosliwc156: despite your biased opinion <br /> Nosliwc156: lol <br /> AngeLuve16: the "fire on the hole!" was kind ofa dead giveaway that he wasn't listening to me <br /> AngeLuve16: but he studies all day now... no time for gracey or counterstrike =( <br /> Nosliwc156: you're making me laugh REALLY hard <br /> Nosliwc156: reminds me of a comic that makes me laugh a lot <br /> AngeLuve16: I don't understand the appeal of the game <br /> Nosliwc156: haha <br /> AngeLuve16: and why they can't learn to say other things... <br /><br />-Chad
