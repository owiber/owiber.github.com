<a href="http://blogs.smugmug.com/don/2007/02/14/this-is-your-mac-on-drugs/">Here</a> is a good blog post on color space issues on Macs.

Also, note to others:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Claiborne">Shane Claiborne</a> is coming to speak at Vox tomorrow.  He wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Irresistible-Revolution-Living-Ordinary-Radical/dp/0310266300">Irresistible Revolution</a> which I've found to be a pretty challenging and interesting book.  He was mentored by Tony Campolo, who came to speak when Liquid was at Red River a while ago.

We'll also be showing another video from the Invisible Children people.  I'm not sure what the title is (might be the same: "Invisible Children?") but this one is about when they went back a second time.

Anyways, the more the merrier, come come!
