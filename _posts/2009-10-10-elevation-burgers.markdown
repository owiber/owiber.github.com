I am not a fan of the "organic burgers" craze especially when bacon becomes the scape-goat in the latest "hip eateries" that are "healthy burgers."  Tonight, I went to Elevation Burgers which seemed to overly emphasize healthy aspects of, let's not kid anyone here, unhealthy food.  Do I eat a burger to be healthy?  No.

Okay, maybe I'm just upset they didn't have bacon (P.Terry's, here's looking at you, too), but Elevation Burgers even emphasized that they had organic butter.  People!  It's still freakin' <em>butter</em>.

I made a new poster for EB that I think they can use in the future if they want to make people think they can lose weight and be healthy by eating burgers.
