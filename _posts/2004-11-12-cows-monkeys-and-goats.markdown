A few minutes ago, while walking out of <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/ens.html">ENS</a> and listening to <a href="http://www.plyrics.com/lyrics/fiveironfrenzy/everynewday.html">Every New Day</a> and <a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/grossepointeblank/underpressure.htm">Under Pressure</a>, a really goofy smile developed on my face.  It hit me how blessed I am in my life and how happy I should be... sooo... I just want  to give a shout out to God, family, and friends (despite being jerks most of the time... jerks! haha, j/k =).  You guys are awesome, thanks for everything. =)
