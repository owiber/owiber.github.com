Okay, I'm going to confess that I'm pretty nervous about this game.  However, I didn't have much hope the last time this happened either.  <a href="http://www.owiber.com/2006/01/05/wow/#header">That time</a>, which was pretty ridiculous, I updated the accent color on OliverWEB to be orange to celebrate the win.  Coincidentally, the previous accent color <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/index06.php">was also pink</a> back then (pardon the shirtless pics =p)...

I'll do that again this year should we come out with the win.

HOOK 'EM!!
