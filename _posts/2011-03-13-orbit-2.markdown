I have a number of topics to post about, but I haven't found the time.  I'll get to them eventually...

This is my dog, Orbit:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/2238731694/" title="Thanksgiving-016 by owiber, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2159/2238731694_9fcfe31faa.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Thanksgiving-016" /></a>

He shall be missed. =(  He lived a long life though... about 16 years?  Good bye, Orbit, you were a good dog. =)  RIP.
