So, after installing a <a href="http://botoxdragons.oliverweb.com">wiki</a> for Botox Dragons, I've determined that 1and1's SQL server is extremely sluggish.  This won't do!

I'm thinking about going to <a href="http://www.pair.net">pair</a> because they're pretty top-notch (but pricier than the rest... I'm pretty confident I'll be satisfied with speed/uptime/etc. though).  Anyone else know of any good hosts?  I don't want to get stuck with another company that overloads their servers with too many clients though... and if you have SQL server experience with a host, that'd be a plus. =)
