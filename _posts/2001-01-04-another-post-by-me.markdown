Am I the only one posting anymore?  Gosh... 3 in a row...  OK, I would like to assure everyone, that there is room to hope for the American public... Olivers rating, with time, eventually went down to a 7... still beating me by .1, but he no longer has the highest rating... Olivia's picture holds that one so far with a 7.3(?).   But fear not!  This picture rating sham is not yet over!  As there will still be pictures to rate!  =)  hehe, if you want one put up there, let me know!  I know some people deathly dont want me to either, if you dont, let me know too... just in case I forget =)<br /><br />BTW... on Olivers rating... statistically speaking, there is a margin of error... I figure it to be about 70% (ha!  that math is wrong)  with a group of only 300 and not even random!  so i figure he deserved a zero... but thats just my opinion =)  sorry Oliver =)  ook!  tata!<br /><br />-Minix
