Alright, at District this weekend, there were two girls competing in HI and DI... (Humourous Interp and Dramatic Interp)  the definition for how judges should rate contestants, is based on their voice inflections in conveying the message of the piece... the two girls are deaf, and can't speak... <br /><br />NFL stated that they couldn't compete, because of the rules... so they sued the NFL, and had a federal court hearing on it...<br /><br />Because of this, HI and DI are now postponded for almost a month... <br /><br />what are your opinions on this?<br /><br />personally, my feelings are, that while I'm impressed that they want to compete, and I wont deny the importance of humourus and dramatic acting for deaf people... I don't think they should be competing at a speech tournament... I'm going to quote Brian... "You don't see people in wheelchairs suing to play football."  <br /><br />Maybe I'm just being a jerk... but the fact is, judges can't understand their pieces, but certainly wont give them last out of pity... <br /><br />Please share...<br /><br />-Minix
