I made a fake Sam Ni FB account a while back and Sam made the foolish decision of friending it last night, which gave me access to post to his wall...

<a href="http://www.owiber.com/?attachment_id=1246" rel="attachment wp-att-1246"><img src="http://www.owiber.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/fakesam1.png" alt="" title="fakesam1" width="510" height="969" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1246" /></a>

I figured the account would get closed shortly, so I'd make the most of it...

...and I think I was being nice... I could have done far worse. =)

Yes, I'm posting this while at work, but it's my lunch break! ;)
