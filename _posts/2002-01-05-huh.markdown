Hello all. I am currently really confused. Oliver is STILL sleeping away underneath a pink blanket and Doris and Matt are reading an...Xmen book i think, but i think they are substituting names with Orbit, Matt, and Doris. Yeah....and i think, matt is spose to be judging again at noon, but it's like 15 till and we're still sitting here...and that's all oliver's fault. he was spose to get up 6 hours ago! How does oliver sleep through this? I stole 3 of this stuffed animals, i mean 4, a ninja turtle, Super Smash Brothers, Titanic Soundtrack, a natural science tshirt, and i was going to steal this carpet stain remover but his mom said it mite spill. But she provided me a plastic bag to carry my stolen goods away. <br /><br />-Oliver
