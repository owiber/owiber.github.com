I grabbed a few old photos and uploaded them to Flickr, mostly for back-up's sake.  I'm not entirely sure where the full size ones are, but I'm sure they're <em>somewhere</em>.  Here're a few notable ones:

The Barbie Hummer!

So... I had to do a ridiculous amount of work to get these images to work with my Flickr stuff on the site because apparently if your original image is the size of the Flickr "Large" image (1024px width or height), Flickr doesn't generate a Large image so I can't count on that URL existing.  Also, the original image URL is obfuscated (I assume so you can't easily download someone's full-size image if they don't want you to).  I eventually had to get my own Flickr API key and write a server side service to find out the Large (or equivalent) image URL to use.  *whew*  It works though!  Let me know if you have any issues.
