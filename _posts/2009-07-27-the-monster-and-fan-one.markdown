I mentioned this earlier, but I went to the <a href="https://www.owiber.com/2009/07/25/monster-shoot/">monster shoot</a> at Carolee and Christopher's.  Then, I went to Home Depot and got a ceiling fan for my living room that Mark and Andrew helped install, which turned out to be quite an effort since we had to rewrite some switches.  Later, we played a bit of Serious Sam: The Second Encounter.  That game is so crazy, but oh so awesome.

We had a discussion about comics and super-hero movies.  I haven't been into the comic world much, but apparently both Marvel and DC have severely messed up universes now.  DC just loves their ridiculous "multiverses" where they have huge story-arcs that aren't entertaining at all due to confusing "timelines" just to explain away inconsistencies.  I stopped reading when they had their stupid "Infinite Crisis" and came out with characters such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superboy-Prime">Superboy-Prime</a>.  Whose bright idea was it to dilute the Superman character by creating a whole ton of other versions of him and make some of them bad?  Superboy-Prime just sounds really <em>lame</em>, too. How in the world is a kid or comic new-comer supposed to get into these plots when you have to have a huge diagram just to know what's going on?

Marvel, apparently, decided to throw away a bunch of plot as well by just saying "oh, these super heroes?  they were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Invasion">actually aliens</a> for the past few years."  Sigh.  Oh yeah, and reviving "dead" characters isn't uncommon in comics, but the recent Captain America one is just ridiculous.  That bullet that apparently killed him?  Oh yeah, no nevermind, that was actually a special bullet that transported him to another time and place.  Oh really, Marvel?  That makes a lot of sense.  That's what I see here... yeah, it's Captain America being transported to another place and time.

Let me treat you to this beauty of story-writing (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_crisis">Wikipedia</a>):

<blockquote>"Darkseid's essence attempts to claim the Miracle Machine in a last ditch effort to defeat Superman. However, Superman sang a note at a frequency that countered Darkseid's own vibrational frequency, shattering his essence."</blockquote>

Yay!  That's just what everyone wanted Superman to have.  Super-<em>song</em>.  Here's another character that had this power (well, kinda):

Sigh.  Someone get these comic writers out of their bubble.  They need some fresh air to get back to good story-telling rather than coming up with convoluted garbage.

On a WoW-related note, I logged in to finally do my Paladin quest to get <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=7328">Redemption</a>.  I checked my /played time and it's at about 14 hours.  Not bad for almost level 44. =)
