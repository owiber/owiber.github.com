Our next place was supposed to be a BBQ place called Allen and Son's, but they were closed (not sure why) so we ended up at...

Stop 6 - The Barbecue Joint:

This was the place that had the awesome chowder (smoked scallops + bacon):

When we arrived in Newark, we slept in the parking lot for a few hours (before taking a train to NYC):

Stop 7 - Tung Yi Fung (dim sum):
When we walked in, we knew it was a good place because everyone there was Chinese.  I mean <em>everyone</em>.  Mark says a white guy walked in as we were leaving, but he was a serviceman.  They spoke Cantonese everywhere, so I just pointed at all the dishes we wanted.

They sat us at a table with two older Chinese women who attempted to talk to me, but I just smiled and shook my head at them saying "sorry, I don't speak Chinese."  After that, they discussed amongst themselves about how I did/didn't look Chinese and stared at me a few times.  Dim sum meal costed us $25 total for all of us including tax and tip.  It was awesome.

Stop 7.5 - Baked:
