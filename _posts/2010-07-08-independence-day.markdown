Let's see... what happened this weekend?  I probably need to be more prompt with these weekend updates or else I forget.  Saturday, we played ultimate which was pretty fun.  I got new shoes that I think were much better at keeping me from injuring myself, but I felt slower.  Not sure if that was due to the shoes or not though.  I don't remember what else happened on Saturday...

On Sunday, we went to the Quarries to watch fireworks at Andrew's suggestion.  I was very pleased since it was so close to my house and we didn't have to fight a mad rush of people getting in and out.  Here are some pics from that:

Melissa grew fangs and so I had to drive a stake into her heart. =(

... she might come back to life next week though.

On Monday, we played video games, cooked meat, and made chili.  I forgot to take pictures.
