This weekend, we had a pretty sweet game of ultimate.  The weather was great and we ended with a pretty good 4v4.  After ultimate, we watched the really unenjoyable UT/Tech game and then Saturday night was really boring after that.  Viraj and I just sat around watching dumb TV until Mark showed up then we played a few games of DotA against computers.

Sunday was not much more eventful, but I went to campus Torchy's and ate with Sam, Oriana, Steph and Laudie.  After that, I repeated the sitting around bored at my house with Sam.  Eventually, I remembered that I got loaned a set of Planetary comics so I started reading those again.  I finished it not too long ago.  Pretty enjoyable.
