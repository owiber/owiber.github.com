Also, these earrings that I ordered a while ago came in:

They're NOT for me, but they were too awesome for me not to get. I'm guessing they'll go to some lucky nerd girl at some point, haha.

This past week, I gave a demo to the entire company, which is quite a lot of people now. It thankfully went well, which was awesome because the demo crashed and burned at the dry-run we had, but I guess that's why you have dry-runs. =) I'm generally not nervous when presenting on topics I'm knowledgeable about, but now that we're a couple hundred people and presentations like this are more of a production, I was really feeling the pressure. Like I said, it went well though, so I've got nothing to complain about. =)

Rapid fire news!

	<li>I ordered a new MacBook Pro (retina, of course).</li>
	<li>Sam decided to introduce me to new people. ;)</li>
	<li>Mozilla's been farting a lot today. Think I'm going to switch to another brand of food.</li>
	<li>Viraj ditched us this weekend for his cousins, who I guess he's contracted Sam's issue because according to Andrew, he's really flirty with them. =)</li>

Oh, and I guess I'll steal this from Oriana:
