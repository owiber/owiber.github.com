My fireplace is currently hidden behind my couch and I'm pretty sure I will never use it.  However, after a conversation with Nancy, it will soon have purpose other than just being in the way.  Woo!  More updates to follow... hopefully tomorrow or the day after. =)

On another note, I am taking the week after Thanksgiving off.  Mark and Andrew will be over and we will be making lots of meat.  It will be known as <em>meatcation</em>.

Such a site, you're lookin' better than a body has a right to.
Don't you know we're playin' with the fire?
But we can stop this burnin' desire, Leah!

Ah! Leah! Here we go again!" - Donnie Iris</blockquote>
