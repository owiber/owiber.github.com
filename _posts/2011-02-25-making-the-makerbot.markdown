Last week, Andrew cryptically scheduled Ryan for a day of <em>something</em>.  No one really knew what Andrew was up to, so we weren't sure whether Ryan would be alive after that day.  Turns out, Andrew bought the parts to assemble a MakerBot, so Mark, Andrew and Ryan set out to make the MakerBot so they could make other stuff.  Oh... Sam joined for a brief period of time.

They finished really early this morning, but I took a few photos last night.  I played around with the processing a bit... hope it's not annoying. ;)
