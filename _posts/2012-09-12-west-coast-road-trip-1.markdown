I probably won't blog about the whole thing right now, but I'll cover a few highlights and revisit. It took Sam and I roughly 14 hours to get to Seattle due to flights getting delayed/canceled, etc. The one nice thing about that is that I got upgraded to first class flying to Seattle from Houston. I've got a ton of pics <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157631517212204/">here</a>, but I'll directly include a few...

One of our first stops as a complete group was to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/nielsens-authentic-danish-pastry-seattle">Nielsen's Authentic Danish Pastries</a>. The danish I got was, in fact, very tasty. Recommended.

Prior to Sam, TC and I's arrival, the group went to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-seattle">Serious Pie</a>, but decided to go back again for first lunch. I had been there previously on a business trip and it did not disappoint the second time around. Recommended.

We walked around Pike Place Market, met up with Victoria, and then walked a mile and some to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/pike-street-fish-fry-seattle">Pike Street Fish Fry</a> and had some tasty "fish and chips" for second lunch. Recommended.

Off to Portland we go, and after checking in to our hotel, we hit up <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/aviary-portland">Aviary</a>. It was really good. Highly recommended.

For a late night snack, we hit up <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/biwa-portland">Biwa</a>. For some reason we thought they closed really late, but we got there right as they were closing up but they sat us anyways. Though the food was good, can't say it stood out any IMO. If I lived in the area, I could see myself going back, but I probably wouldn't make a point of visiting again.

In the morning, we waited a long time to eat at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-n-sons-portland">Tasty N Sons</a>. It was worth the wait. Very recommended.

For lunch, we hit up <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/pok-pok-portland">Pok Pok</a>, which was great. Highly recommended. Get the chicken wings. They were amazing. Afterwards, we got more dessert at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/scoop-handmade-ice-cream-portland">Scoop</a>.

After that, we make the long drive to San Francisco...

...and make a quick stop at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/voodoo-doughnut-eugene">Voodoo</a>. It was alright.

We arrive in SF really early in the morning, but wake up in order to get some Chinese baked goods at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/napoleon-super-bakery-san-francisco">Napoleon Super Bakery</a>, accompanied by Tiff, Alex, and Kelsey who were wonderful guides. The dan tats (all I cared about) were good!

Our planned lunch, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/swan-oyster-depot-san-francisco">Swan Oyster Depot</a>, was unfortunately closed for Labor Day, so we hit up <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/shalimar-san-francisco">Shalimar</a> instead where I got some brains to eat. It was tasty.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/7978273651/" title="Road Trip 2012 116 by owiber, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8461/7978273651_27ddf6ea57.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Road Trip 2012 116"></a>

A few of us then went to get ice cream at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/smitten-ice-cream-san-francisco">Smitten</a> which also was tasty.

Off to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-french-laundry-yountville-2">French Laundry</a> we go, all dressed up!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/7978280806/" title="Road Trip 2012 125 by owiber, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8307/7978280806_0dfa897f5b.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Road Trip 2012 125"></a>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/7978280611/" title="Road Trip 2012 126 by owiber, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8306/7978280611_a409c6eece.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Road Trip 2012 126"></a>

Unfortunately, I can't say I'd recommend French Laundry. While I don't regret going, I wouldn't go again. The food was good, but not good enough to justify the price (I'd much prefer Alinea), and the service was so formal, it was awkward. I guess some people may like that type of service, but I found it a bit stifling. We had a good time regardless though, and there were definitely a few dishes that were pretty tasty, I just can't say I'd highly recommend it to anyone.

The next day, we go kind of crazy and book two lunches and two dinners. For first lunch, we go back to Swan Oyster Depot. I'm super glad we did. This place was awesome, especially the smoked salmon. Highly recommended.

For second lunch, we went to a Burmese place, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/burma-superstar-san-francisco">Burma Superstar</a>. It was really good. Highly recommended. Nancy really liked the tofu.

After that, we hit up the Golden Gate Bridge and the Steinhart Aquarium.
