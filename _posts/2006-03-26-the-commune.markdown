Ahh, so I'm sitting at the apartment all alone and just chilling to my recent purchase of nearly fifty 80's songs, haha.  Before leaving to run around town earlier today, I paused in silence and looked around the room.  This place isn't very homely, clean, or attractive, but I think I'll miss it once we all move out in a few months.  Despite all of us having different schedules and misc. events in our lives, it was always pretty cool to have the apartment as our central hub where we'd run into each other and just hang out in silence or have random conversations of varying levels of intelligence. =)  Good memories here, guys.
