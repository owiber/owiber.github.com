I really need to bump that image of the 1D Mark III down a bit before it gets released or I fear there shall be no return for me. =)

I have been looking for a CF card and card reader for the past few weeks and I have no idea where it is.  It'll be a little while card reader (kinda Mac-ish), with a green 2GB Transcend CF card in it (I think).  If anyone has seen it, please let me know. =)  I thought I left it in my room, but I can't find it anywhere.

Now, I must find something to eat...
