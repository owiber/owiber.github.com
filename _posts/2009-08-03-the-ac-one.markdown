This weekend started off poorly with my A/C not turning on.  It ended up being because the drain pipe was clogged so the system automatically shut off to prevent my house from flooding.  At least it was a relatively easy fix.  Weekend was rather uneventful other than that... I played around with <a href="https://www.owiber.com/2009/08/02/applescript-itunes-ichat/">AppleScript/iTunes/iChat</a>, went to get some dim sum with some of the BV gang, and did some misc errands and cleaned the house a little.

I have a headache right now that I think is due to me needing a new contact prescription (I believe they have gotten worse again - so I am even more blind than before).  I'm gonna have to make an appointment tomorrow and take care of that...
