<blockquote class="lyrics">"I don't know just how this happened
I didn't think it ever could,
I'm the author of sappy love songs,
Trading in my bachelorhood.
Something snapped deep inside me,
Something that somebody said,
I felt the brush of angels wings then,
Your voice echoed in my head.

Ugly Day the sun is shining,
Every cloud's got a silver lining.
Ugly day the skies are blue,
Now every day is ugly without you.

Are the one pure thing,
That I've always prayed for.
Scales are falling from my eyes,
I must have been so blind before.
I would lie down on the street,
To keep the dust off of your feet,
I would kneel each time I kissed you,
Anything Christie I miss you." - Five Iron Frenzy</blockquote>

Haha, that song always reminds me of the time in high school when you bums made Kristy think I liked her.  Andrew would consistently tell her "Oliver says hi" at tennis.  Bums! =)  It made things very awkward... haha.  I went digging through some of my old chats...

<blockquote>WangFeiXTC: NNN NNNN
WangFeiXTC: ask for kristy
WangFeiXTC: when I get offline
WangFeiXTC: = ]
PiFactor5: shad up
PiFactor5: I'm not going to call
WangFeiXTC: I'm just helping you out
WangFeiXTC: ; )
WangFeiXTC: that's what friends do</blockquote>

And...

<blockquote>WangFeiXTC: marry my sister kay ?
WangFeiXTC: so you can support me
PiFactor5: shut up!
WangFeiXTC: ; ] </blockquote>
