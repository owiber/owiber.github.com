Weeeeee. So... I beat 1:08:500 in Baby Park a few days ago... pass/failed two of my classes and should currently be studying for my Chinese quiz "tomorrow" but I'm really really not feeling like it. =)<br /><br />OMan just turned 21! It's kinda weird watching everyone hit the big 21, I always saw the 20's as being so far away, I don't feel it at all. Heck, I only have one more year left of school! AAAAAHHHHHH!!<br /><br />I need to find something I can consistantly talk about on OWeb... I find it difficult to come up with stuff sometimes.<br /><br />Hmmm...<br /><br />-Oliver
