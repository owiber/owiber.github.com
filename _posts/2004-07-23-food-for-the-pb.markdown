Today, I am going to buy some more RAM for my PB.  It is disturbingly slow at the moment swapping like crazy with the slow 4200RPM drive right now.  It is almost unbearable, especially compared to my new A64 3200+, the Pentium-M 1.7GHz, and P4 2.8GHz workstation I've been used to for the past few weeks. Actually, it is unbearable... but I am getting through it by telling myself that I will be replacing the slow parts soon (hopefully).  Soo... I'll see how much an extra 512MB of RAM will help.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=1064001118794&skuId=5958911&type=product&productCategoryId=cat01170&cmp=++>Kingston 512MB PC2700 DDR SoDIMM from BestBuy</a> - <a href=http://postpublisher.net/h/bestbuy/adhoc/200407/ESE/coupon2.htm?>10% </a> - <a href=http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=cat12105&type=page&rebateid=49234&skuid=5958911>$20 MIR</a> = ~$87 after tax.<br /><br />-Oliver
