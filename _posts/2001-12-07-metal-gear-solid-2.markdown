I finally beat the game... I laughed, I cried... and then I looked up Konami's address in Japan, and sent a nuclear weapon to them... Some of you will have no idea what I'm talking about, others will understand... I've played crappy games... but no game has angered me more than this one... If you haven't bought this game, and plan to in the future, think twice... the first 2 hours are cool, then... you keep asking yourself "What were they on?"  and in the final hour or so, you start asking yourself "What am I on?"  Theres nothing more I can say... it just sucked.<br /><br />-Minix
