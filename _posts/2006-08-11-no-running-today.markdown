So I drove over to Town Lake after work today and apparently they closed off the area I usually park at and instead forced me back onto Mopac south during rush hour.  Thanks a lot.  I spent the next 20 minutes bumper to bumper until I could finally get off and turn around to go back north.  By that time I was so fed up I just gave up and went back to the apartment.

In other news, I have decided I am going to wear jeans and a pink polo tomorrow.  It's going to be <i>hawt</i>.  And somehow, I think these carefully selected lyrics are very fitting... ;)

What ya doin' tonight, (hey boy)
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old fashioned lover boy."</i> - Queen
