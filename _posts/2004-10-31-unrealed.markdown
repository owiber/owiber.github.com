I hate <a href="http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/">UnrealEd</a>. Anyways, I worked on my level for my Game Development class a bit.  I'll post a screenshot in a bit maybe.  Van also cleaned like crazy today, and um... I helped a little.  lol =)

<b>Update:</b> Screenshot uploaded.  We're using a default Unreal dude right now, but he will be replaced!
