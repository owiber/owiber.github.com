Man, J.R.R. has to be one of the coolest dudes ever. I'm only half-way through LOTR, but I like it a lot. He just has a way of putting certain things into words (and by "words" I also mean the ones he made up =) to make it sound <i>cool</i>. I was talking to Mark and concluded that I would have very much liked to have hung out with Lewis and Tolkien (btw, what's with the initials? J.R.R, C.S.?) and smoked pipe with them in Oxford... even though that's probably what ended their lives.<br /><br /><i>Mithrander</i>... man, that's just so COOL. I don't know why I like it so much, but I think Tolkien's languages are really really spiffy. I, for one, would have no objection to this guy actually creating a real language for people to speak... it'd be the language of coolness. =)<br />

<br />Argh, so cool!<br /><br />I've decided my son's name is going to be Mithrandir...<br /><br />Okay, fine... maybe just his middle name. ;)<br /><br />-Oliver
