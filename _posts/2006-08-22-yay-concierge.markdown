Freescale has a concierge service (which I think they contract from another company or something) which I've found useful on a few occasions.  Today, I had the guy take my car to get an oil change. Wheeee!

Although, I just realized that since I'm taking tomorrow off, I could have done it then.  Oh well, more time to <i>relaaaaax</i>. =)

Uh oh, meeting time...

And all the milk has turned
And Captain Crunch is waving farewell
When the big one finds you
May this song remind you
That they don't serve breakfast in hell"</i> - Newsboys
