I haven't posted in a while... I should start doing that more. I think I need to try to get into the habit of treating OWeb like an online journal/diary/whatever again, it's been kinda neglected lately...<br /><br />Well, I need to do physics... but on the bright side I've only got two more classes to go (one being the final)...<br /><br />Hope everyone is looking forward to school coming back around like I am! =)<br /><br />-Oliver
