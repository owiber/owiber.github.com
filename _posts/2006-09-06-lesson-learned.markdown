I hope you learn your lesson, Sam!  Image hotlinking is for lamers!  And no credit either... tsk tsk.

Say Jerry Springer were the president
“No Inhibitions!”
The national theme
There’d still be one thing

“Taboo!”
We’ve come to the last
Taboo
There’s an audible gasp
When you claim there’s a God
Who’s objectively true
It’s taboo" - Ian Eskelin</blockquote>
