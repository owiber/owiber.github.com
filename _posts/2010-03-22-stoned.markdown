This weekend, other than the <a href="https://www.owiber.com/2010/03/20/ultimately-windy/#header">super windy ultimate game</a>, Melissa and I finished watching Firefly and Serenity (ahhh... I <3 that show/movie so much).  It's been decided that the next show will be Pushing Daisies, so I ordered both seasons on blu-ray, which should arrive shortly.  I've heard good things about that show from many sources, so I didn't mind buying before seeing any of it... looking forward to it. =)

Sunday, I went to <a href="http://www.voxveniae.com/">Vox</a>, ate at Ho Ho, went misc. shopping a bit and got cleaning supplies (but did not clean).  Took a short nap, then visited <a href="http://www.austinstone.org/">Austin Stone</a> (hence the post title... har har!) with Melissa.  It was my first time and boy... a lot of people go there!  After going to Vox for so long, it would take some getting used to should I visit Stone again (not necessarily in a good/bad way).  I found out Melissa hadn't seen Up, so I decided to try my luck at this whole social thing and sent out <a href="http://twitter.com/owiber/status/10849666538">a tweet</a> asking if anyone had a copy I could borrow.  Carolee graciously obliged (thanks!) and so we closed out the night watching that.
