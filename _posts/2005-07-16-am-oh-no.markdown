It's so early in the morning I have no idea why I'm still awake.  I feel like posting stuff on OliverWEB, but I have no clue what to write about. =/ This probably happens to me in conversations too, I just run out of things to talk about. So, here you see, I'm talking about having nothing to talk about.

Whew. Maybe that was the ice-breaker paragraph I needed.

Oh... no, doesn't look like it.

LAME.
