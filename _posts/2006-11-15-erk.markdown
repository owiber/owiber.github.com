So I woke up last night in a fit of coughing and ran to the bathroom and threw up.  I don't think I really have any stomach issues, I probably just got way too much air in there or something and lots of uncontrollable coughing can make you do that I suppose.  Anyways, after that I seem to have slept decently well and I'm feeling better now and am coughing less frequently, so no worries. =p

I was chuckling to myself about if Van were there and woke up to me puking in the toilet, came over to see what was going on and saw me kinda slumped over in the bathroom.  It seems like it would have looked like I had a wild night out and drank way too much or something... haha...

My memory of this trip to the bathroom is kinda interesting and very fuzzy (probably because my vision was really fuzzy since I didn't have my glasses or contacts in).  I'm not quite sure how to explain it...

Mmmm, been a while since I listened to BSS...
