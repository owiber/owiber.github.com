I was digging through my blog archives and I think I'm setting some kind of record for blogs in a month.  Anyways, I ran across <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/archives/2006/03/safari_crash.php">this</a> and it <i>still</i> crashes Safari.

I also noticed that in <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/archives/2005/01/">January of 2005</a>, I only blogged twice.  Haha, I *think* that was also a record, but I didn't go through every single month to make sure.

Yeah... was in an All Star United mood (two in a row). =)
