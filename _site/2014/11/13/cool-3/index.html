  <p>Ok, blog, here&#39;s my middle school story that I was recently reminded of when someone asked me what I would do if I could turn back time.</p>

<p>First, you&#39;ll have to understand that I was quite a dweeby little asian boy. Surprising, I know. I was smaller than my peers, had rather dorky large glasses, and definitely had your stereotypical nerdy asian boy thing going on. In physical activities, I did alright when I was up against my own weight (running, pull ups, etc.) but not so hot when pitted against others (tackling).</p>

<p>So one day in my PE class, we&#39;re playing flag football. Sometimes, devious kids would try to tie their belt around their waist so that it would be hard to pull off. I wouldn&#39;t do that, but since I was so small, the belts were usually too large for me and one end would hang down really low, so I&#39;d take the end and tuck it into the belt around my waist so it wouldn&#39;t swing wildly as I ran.</p>

<p>My PE coach was all-time quarterback and for some reason on the last play of the game, he throws the ball to me. I somehow catch the ball! Amazing! I start running towards the end zone and weave my way around multiple defenders who were probably in a state of shock that I even caught the ball. I was fairly zippy once I get going so I actually make it to the end zone. Touchdown! I was so proud of myself! That was rather short-lived, however, as some kid quickly runs over to me and yanks pretty hard on one of my flags. I expected it to just fall off, but he apparently yanked quickly enough where the end that I had tucked in created a knot so the belt &quot;tied itself&quot; and he basically lifted me up a short distance by my belt. Oh no! Everyone thinks I cheated now! Shame!</p>

<p>So that&#39;s how I failed to secure glory for the nerds and instead was awarded shame upon my family for cheating at flag football. If I could turn back time, I would figure out a different way to tuck in that belt. I&#39;m pretty sure I would have been king middle school once news of my victorious run made its way through the grapevine, but alas...</p>
