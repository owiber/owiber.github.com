  <h1 class="page-title">About Oliver Wong</h1>
  <p>I&#39;m Oliver Wong and this is my humble blog.  I went to <a href="http://www.utexas.edu">UT Austin</a> and graduated with a Computer Science degree.  I am currently happily employed at <del><a href="http://www.bazaarvoice.com">Bazaarvoice</a></del> <del><a href="http://www.massrelevance.com">Mass Relevance</a></del> <del><a href="http://www.spredfast.com">Spredfast</a></del> <a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a></del>.  I enjoy <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber">photography</a>, hanging out with friends, playing video games, web design and other similarly nerdy things. =)  My usual online alias is &quot;Owiber&quot; and I don&#39;t remember how I came up with that, but it&#39;s pretty convenient.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty easy-going most of the time.  In high school, my English teacher told me to read out a passage (perhaps from a poem, I can&#39;t remember), which I did, but then she requested I do it again because I wasn&#39;t &quot;angry enough.&quot;  I responded with &quot;Ms. K, I&#39;m not a very angry person&quot; which made the whole class laugh because they knew it was true.  There are, however, certain topics that will annoy me quite a bit, but I won&#39;t go into those here for fear of them being used against me... ;-)</p>

<del>I play WoW with my friends and have a shaman with parents who named him while drunk on some stolen dwarven ale, [Herthumpus](http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Laughing+Skull&n=Herthumpus) and an albino druid who aspires to be famous like Bono: [Albono](http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Laughing+Skull&n=Albono).
</del>

<p>I&#39;m on the usual social networking sites, primarily driven out of boredom (except for flickr, which I generally enjoy using regardless).  You can find me there here:</p>

<p>I have a habit of making mock sites dealing with my roommates.  On Xanga, I live an alternate life of heart brokenness after the many years of abuse from my college roommate, <a href="http://sammaverick.com">Sam Ni</a>.  <a href="http://owiber.xanga.com">Xanga Owiber</a> has gone through various phases in his sad life and is currently on a goth streak as far as I can tell, but has been rather silent as of late.  I also maintain a <em>very popular</em> <em>cough</em> reporting site, <a href="http://www.andrewapproved.com">AndrewApproved.com</a> which is dedicated to my dear friend Andrew Joseph and all things that he <em>loves loves loves</em>.  Finally, I created a Twitter account for my current roomy: <a href="http://twitter.com/jryanfunsponge">JRyanFunSponge</a> (updated by others in addition to myself).</p>

<p>&quot;About Me&quot; pages have gone through various iterations in my online timeline, here&#39;re a few old ones:</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.mrtechhappy.com">MrTechHappy</a> (~2002):</p>

<blockquote>"Oliver Wong is currently a Computer Science major at the University of Texas at Austin and likes to call his major, "Counter-Strike." Having not a great deal of school pride, even in college, he is semi-phobic of swarms of orange which sometimes spring up from nowhere on weekends during the Fall semester. He's the webdesigner and coder for MrTechHappy and has also been doing a majority of the artwork for the comics, basing them off of Brook's original concepts."</blockquote>

<p>In my high school days, I used to be involved in various gaming fan sites, primarily focused around Command &amp; Conquer games (specifically Tiberian Sun, which I think sucked when it actually came out... sigh).  Someone I &quot;worked&quot; with wrote <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/olivetti.shtml">this about me</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoy nostalgic things - movies, songs, etc. probably because I have been blessed with a wonderful life thus far.  I consider myself a &quot;memory pack-rat&quot; and will occasionally go back and hunt through my digital archives and read old chat logs, browse old websites, view old photos, etc.  I have a group of friends that have roots going back to middle school, which I am incredibly happy to have, a family that includes two sisters and a mom who are very loud, but I love regardless, and coworkers who I also very much like but am fond of pulling the &quot;well, I&#39;m hanging out with <em>my friends</em> tonight&quot; card in a teasing manner.</p>

<p>My music taste plays to my affection for nostalgia and I enjoy much of the 80&#39;s.  I am also very fond of ridiculous love songs spanning the past few decades which I find ironic, but that also makes it more fun (much like my endearing thoughts on the color pink).</p>

<p>I&#39;m overall somewhat on the shy side in real life, but I tend to open up a bit more online, so I hear.  I enjoy group events, but also the occasional solo-time with a good friend.  Usually perfectly fine with sitting in silence and/or people watching with the right company.  My favorite movie is Transformers:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.owiber.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/transformers_the_movie.jpg" alt="Transformers: The Movie"></p>

<p>I&#39;m single (as of this writing, at least), and not actively searching, but it&#39;s been thought that I will meet my dream girl on a park bench as I solved my rubik&#39;s cube... so if you see me frequenting public parks toting the iconic nerd puzzle in hand, I just might be searching again.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve written way way way too much about myself now, so... cowabunga, dude.</p>
