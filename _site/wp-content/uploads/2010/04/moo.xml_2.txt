	<title>Curse the monkeys!</title>
	<content:encoded>Well POOO!!! I made one stupid mistake on my EE test and so I didn't get the 100 I thought I might've. Darn. =)  Well, I still got a 92 though, which was the 3rd highest in the class, so I'm still looking good.  Just a bit annoying. =)<br><br>Sam recently found a bruise on his right arm in virtually the exact same shape, location, and color as mine.  It's really really weird as the spot it's at isn't really the easiest of spots to get a bruise.  Something's fishy.... lol</content:encoded>

	<title>I am not alone</title>
	<content:encoded>Apparently, people are just walking out of my EE class one by one (as I am typing this).  I think the class is half the size it was when it started 40 minutes ago... haha.  So, I'm not the only one that views this guy's lectures as absolutely worthless.<br><br>In other news, I got a job offer from Freescale, and I have to read A LOT of Buddhism for the test on Thursday.

	<title>Deep Conversations</title>
	<content:encoded>Sam, Andrew, and I (with some input from a few others) were talking about "deep" stuff the other day and I've decided to post about it a bit.  We arrived at the conclusion that pain existed in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:16 - "I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing...") and that pain/suffering is required in a relationship in order to grow (perhaps past a certain "line").  So pretty much, the main question is... what of pain/suffering in heaven?<br><br>According to Revelations (something, too lazy to look it up) and probably some other passages, there will no longer be any pain/suffering in heaven.  What of relationships then?  Do they become stagnant at that point and/or are these questions irrelevant since we can't comprehend heaven and our lives there?<br><br>I think we also talked about the why there is suffering and if it is a direct consequence of sin.  If so, why was there pain/suffering in Garden of Eden?  Because of Lucifer's sin?  I guess this also brings up the question... were Adam & Eve sinless before eating the fruit?  Or "merely" ignorant of their sins?<br><br>I'm not sure if I'm transcribing the ideas we talked about accurately or not... but hey, interesting nonetheless. =)</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Boy I love my EE class. It's so exciting! Actually... no.<br><br>At the moment, I'm in the back of the class typing away on my Powerbook while listening to my iPod.  I have no clue what the professor is saying and I've totally tuned him out.  My phone started ringing though, and that's bad cause today I forgot to silence it.<br><br>This guy is really boring, I think I do better just looking at the book. Lunch with sister today.

	<title>More Apple</title>
	<content:encoded>So, I've gotten more used to the CMD+W/CMD+Q thing.  Here's my experience with the browsers:<br><br><b><a href=http://www.apple.com/safari/>Safari</a></b><blockquote><b>Good:</b> Nice integration with OS (ie. FTP links open in Finder, allowing easy download of folders, multiple files, etc.). <br><b>Bad:</b> Slow w/Gmail.</blockquote><br><b><a href=http://www.mozilla.org/products/camino/>Camino</a></b><blockquote><b>Good:</b> I like the way the tabs look. Haha.<br><b>Bad:</b> Nothing that really stands out... seems to load slightly slower than Safari.</blockquote><br><b><a href=http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/>Firefox</a></b><blockquote><b>Good:</b> Extensions rock. =) Just good 'ole Firefox.<br><b>Bad:</b> CMD+M is b0rk3d, it loads Mail instead of minimizing.</blockquote><br>For now, I've been using Camino... but I have all three in my dock and I change pretty frequently. =)<br><br>Some of OS X's "just works" stuff is kinda nice.  It's nice that they give you (for the most part) nice defaults that most people would want... however, it freakin' ticks me off when you can't change those defaults.  For example, when you plug in an external monitor, it automatically extends the desktop.  Okay, that's good. I like that.  However, what happens when I don't want to use the laptop LCD and I <i>just</i> want the PB to use the external monitor (with the laptop LCD open to use keyboard, touchpad)?... that's right, I can't do it (without some hacking, at least). So anyways, the best I can do for now is to mirror the display, but then I'm stuck at 1024x768 on the external monitor. Ugh.<br><br>Anyone know how to set your own profile in iChat? Yeah, I can't figure that one out yet.<br><br>My CPU temps hit 66.8C today while compiling KDE.  I flipped the PB on its side now (bottom of PB is perpendicular to table)... it cooled down to <65C... heh.<br><br>I had a big experience of inadequacy when it came to free "native" (as in, not using gFTP or something through X11) FTP clients for OS X.  So much so, that I started to look into writing my own.  I found that UT gave us Fetch for "free" (w/Bevoware) though, so I've played around with that and it seems like it would do the job.  Perhaps I'll write my own eventually anyways though, might be a nice little project to undertake. <br><br>Hmmm... oh, I LOVE <a href=http://synergy2.sourceforge.net>Synergy</a>.</content:encoded>

	<title>Apple... stuff</title>
	<content:encoded>Alright... so the new HD is in and boot time and application launching is faster.  I still don't have that "snappy" feeling to the UI though. *shrug* Guess that's what happens when you have a power-hungry eye-candy-filled GUI.  I think the G5's have that "snappy" feeling... but I guess my 1.33 G4 is far from a dual G5. =)<br><br>I need to find a good graphical FTP client.  I tried one out, but I got frustrated with it cause it was screwing stuff up so I just went over to my A64 box and did what I needed there.  <a href=http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/>Fugu</a> is supposedly pretty good, but it only supports SFTP and not regular FTP... at least, that's what I can gather.<br><br>I did this when I first got the PB, but after the reinstall, I forgot and it took me freakin' forever to figure it out again.  In .vimrc, do this to fix delete key:<br><br>set t_kb=^?<br>fixdel<br><br>Where ^? is CTRL+V+DELETE.  I wish Apple set their vim defaults to something nice by default like virtually every Linux distro out there.<br><br>Oh yeah, if you format the iPod for Windows, you can use it on both Windows and OS X as both an iPod and removable hard drive.  Hmmmmm... what else... I haven't made too much use of Expose yet, so I won't say much about that yet.  The CMD+W, CMD+Q thing still bugs me a little, but I'm slowly getting more used to it.<br><br>I'd say my iPod experience has been more enjoyable than my PB experience thus far, but I definately need to get used to some of this stuff (*cough*FREAKING ONE BUTTON*cough*).  Thank goodness for <a href=http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/20854>SideTrack</a> or I would be really really not liking this.  Default touchpad speed and acceleration is also a bit slow, Sidetrack fixed that for me too.  Right now I have the tap on the touchpad being the right click, which is working okay for me.<br><br>I like how Safari opens FTP sites in Finder, but it doesn't seem to like Gmail very much and waddles through that much slower than Camino or FireFox.  I made Camino my default browser for now...<br><br>iChat is kinda fruity, so I made it even fruitier... that's the only way I can use.  The bubbles are kinda growing on me, I blame Brook for this one.  Terminal is the lame.  I very quickly replaced it with iTerm.  However, there is a "make delete send backspace" option in Terminal which is nice (this makes the above t_kb thing in .vimrc unnecessary).<br><br>Hmmmm, let's see... what else... oh yeah, Chad, you can turn on the ability to tab through alert buttons and stuff in System Preferences->Keyboard & Mouse->Keyboard Shortcuts->Turn on full keyboard access.  I don't know why this isn't on by default... oh well, at least it's there.<br><br>Alright, well I've got a ton more stuff to play with, so I'm off! =)</content:encoded>

	<title>FOOD FOR THE PB</title>
	<content:encoded>Today, I am going to buy some more RAM for my PB.  It is disturbingly slow at the moment swapping like crazy with the slow 4200RPM drive right now.  It is almost unbearable, especially compared to my new A64 3200+, the Pentium-M 1.7GHz, and P4 2.8GHz workstation I've been used to for the past few weeks. Actually, it is unbearable... but I am getting through it by telling myself that I will be replacing the slow parts soon (hopefully).  Soo... I'll see how much an extra 512MB of RAM will help.<br><br><a href=http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=1064001118794&skuId=5958911&type=product&productCategoryId=cat01170&cmp=++>Kingston 512MB PC2700 DDR SoDIMM from BestBuy</a> - <a href=http://postpublisher.net/h/bestbuy/adhoc/200407/ESE/coupon2.htm?>10% </a> - <a href=http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=cat12105&type=page&rebateid=49234&skuid=5958911>$20 MIR</a> = ~$87 after tax.</content:encoded>

	<title>PB</title>
	<content:encoded>I feel I must blog about my new PowerBook.  First, I will give you specs:<br><br>12" PB <br>1.33GHz<br>60GB 4200RPM hard drive<b>*</b><br>256MB RAM<b>*</b><br><br>Umm... yeah, that's about all, you can "guess" the rest.  I also got me a nice little 20GB iPod (new 4G one), but I have done little with it other than plug it into the wall and place it on top of a laundry bin. lol<br><br><b>*</b>I plan on replacing that hard drive with either a Toshiba 40GB 5400RPM 16MB cache one or a Hitachi Travelstar 40GB 7200RPM one.  I'm not quite sure which one to go with as of yet.  I could get a 60GB, but I doubt I'm going to be needing all that space (especially with the 20GB from the iPod) so I'd rather save the money.  Also, 512MB RAM from Crucial is in order...<br><br>As for the "Mac experience"... I don't really have too much to say as of yet, mostly because I haven't done that much.  VJ is a freakin' Smallville Nazi and if you even try to blink when you're "supposed" to be watching Smallville, he will attempt to rip your intestines out through your ribs. Which reminds me, VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ.<br><br>So, I'm going to withhold comments on my "Mac experience" until I finish upgrading the little thing, but I will note that I managed to freeze it within a few hours of use and had to hold the power button thingy down to restart it. Booooooo. That's nothing compared to Andrew locking up a G5 in the Apple store though.  What can I say?  We're masters.</content:encoded>

	<title>The Work Chair</title>
	<content:encoded>Well, I'm at work and I would just like to talk about the chair in my cube.  It is terrible.  It's one of those ones that you can adjust the height of, but it will just randomly "shrink."  I have to raise the darn thing like 5 or something times a day.<br><br>Hmmm... maybe I'll steal someone else's... bbl</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Haha... here are pics in case Andrew doesn't have any.<br><br><center><img src=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/revenge/revenge1.jpg width=500 height=375 border=1><br><br><img src=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/revenge/revenge2.jpg width=500 height=375 border=1><br><br><img src=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/revenge/revenge3.jpg width=500 height=375 border=1><br><br><img src=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/andrewcar/revenge/revenge4.jpg width=500 height=375 border=1></center><br><br>The pic of the back is kinda bad... but the stuff on it was kind of washing away anyways. I think the text on the back says "I love my mom" and "I want a girlfriend"? I'm not sure about the girlfriend thing cause that was almost all gone, but yeah. The top says "keep swimming!" =)</content:encoded>

A signature sealing their fate was left on my car.  I remember last year when we used each other's cars as the outlet for our carnage.  It seems that trend continues and much like last summer, I will up the stakes.  My enemies shall fall to their knees before the fortnight of this first attack.  I will strike back without warning and leave a wake of destruction.  You know who you are and more importantly, I know who you are.  So all I can say is beware, beware of the impending retribution.<br><br>-Andrew</i></blockquote><br>=)</content:encoded>

	<title>Friends 2004</title>
	<content:encoded>Sooooooo, I'm actually working on Friends 2004 this year... it's been a while, I think the last one was in 2001, so a lot has changed, it's crazy.  Anyways, I want to throw in a section that has a question submitted from each of you. Sooooo... think of a question and put it in the comments below.  Umm... try to keep it clean and don't make it a typical "what is your favorite book?" type of thing. =)</content:encoded>

	<title>Happy Birthday, Van!</title>
	<content:encoded>Today is Van's bday, happy birthday, Van. =)<br><br>I would also like to say that Day After Tomorrow was like Titanic + Independence Day + Twister all rolled into one and not as good as any of them.  It even had typical overused/done before scenes such as:<ul><li>Guy hanging from rope, cuts himself off, falls to his death to save friends that are holding on to him</li><li>Teenage Guy/Girl thing</li><li>Father/Son thing</li><li>Wolves.</li><li>Running away from monster thing</li></ul>Yeah, again, I would like to say that if this movie was being touted as "the movie the Republicans don't want you to see," by the Democrats then I'd have to say that the Republicans have much better taste than the Democrats. Either that, or the Democrats have a great sense of humor and failed miserably at conveying this film was intended as a comedy... oh, and the Republicans don't want you to see comedies.<br><br>However, there was a bit of good eye candy, and if you don't take the film seriously at all, it can be a good laugh.  I think it would have made a better comedy if they had just taken everything one step further.  For example, here are a few things they could have also thrown in that "the gang" came up with:<ul><li>At the end, we nuke the whole northern hemisphere, mutation goes insane and the dead frozen people in the north "wake up" --> X-Men vs Zombies time.</li><li>At the end, we see a lot of stereotypical people from foreign nations dance around and rejoice as we see the clouds vanish (think end of Independence Day)</li></ul>There's gotta be more things we came up with, but I can't remember them at the moment. There were also a few good jokes thrown in there every so often.  All in all, the movie really was just splices of a bunch of other movies, with blatantly blunt, stupid "in-your-face" attempts at political statements. Feel free to throw in more stuff in the comments. =)</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Well, I just got back from getting a free coke at MTWKS, and I stopped to look out the window. I can see a lot of stuff from there, including McNeil, it's pretty cool. =)  If I were Sam, I'd say something like "wow! talk about a good sniper spot!"... but I'm not. ;P</content:encoded>

	<title>MTWKS</title>
	<content:encoded>Apparently, Motorola/Freescale's "abbreviation" for Metrowerks is MTWKS, which is just ridiculous.  Hehe... anyways, today at work, I saw two CDs on someone's desk that turned out to be the two gold CDs of CodeWarrior for embedded PPC linux. Pretty cool stuff, they were shortly picked up and sent out for mass production. It's really cool to be able to see works in progress and bleeding edge builds of a decently well known commercial product.<br><br>They also have an in-house Linux build of CodeWarrior... pretty nifty stuff. Can't get it anywhere else. =)<br><br>I'm going to copy/paste a little bit of an email I sent to Andrew: Oh yeah, Blizzard uses Metrowerks tools in their games, I saw a poster of WarCraft III that just had the WC3 logo on the top, then it was signed by all the developers... I also saw a Prince of Persia 2 poster somewhere.... wonder if I can get my hands on a beta... =) <br><br>I hope I didn't give away any info I wasn't supposed to...</content:encoded>

	<title>For Yesterday</title>
	<content:encoded>I should have written this yesterday, but as it is apparent (see previous post), I was lazy. =)<br><br>Andrew, Mark and I started the day at 6/7AM ramping up to compete in <a href=http://ipsc.ksp.sk/>IPSC</a>.  I don't care how nerdy/geeky/weird that makes us, but we all had a pretty fun time I think.  Those darn Russians and Chinese middle schoolers. Cheaters! Haha. =)<br><br>We managed to get 4 points which put us right around the 50% mark compared to all the other teams.  If we had played a bit smarter, I'm pretty sure we could have broken 8 points, putting us at around the top 100 (winning team got 19 out of a max of 24... there were probably around 500 - 600 teams).  Oh well, there's always next year.<br><br>I don't really feel like doing a top whatever list for this past year, but definately major shout-outs go Sam and the little fishies he brought along (that'd be Paul and Nathan =).  Definately glad I chose to room with you Sam and getting to you know (corrupting? =) you guys better has been really really cool. Global domination begins behind the Target in August '04. lol</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Argh, this week is going to be pretty yucky starting tomorrow.  I've got an EE test on Wednesday and an Online Game Tech program due on Thurs (might use one late day on that though to make it Fri)... argh, then I gotta work with my Chinese partner to write our skit show. Uber yucky.<br><br>I'm kinda anxious for this semester to end now... it started off alright, but it seems like all my classes converge every once in a while to make a really hectic week, and those tire me out -- I just want to finish and move on to the next semester.  A new set of topics and teachers, please. =)<br><br>Also pretty excited about getting the apartment next year, should be lots of fun, can't wait until moving in day. =)</content:encoded>

I see...<br>Owiber: but how would you do that if you were dead?<br>Owiber: what would have to happen is...<br>Owiber: I'd kill you, then later make a time machine to stop myself<br>Owiber: allowing you to make a time machine to go back to stop me also<br>Owiber: so both of us will be stopping me...<br>Owiber: that doesn't bode too well for me killing you<br>Owiber: lol<br>Drewser2001: interesting, I think it's better if we work together and rule the world as one<br>Owiber: yeah<br>Owiber: but I can still try to kill you since it wouldn't do anything anyways<br>Owiber: lol<br>Drewser2001: but what if we fail with our time machine<br>Drewser2001: then'll i just be dead, and you'll be in jail forever<br>Owiber: but... that's contradictory to our assumption!<br>Owiber: that really ruins everything then<br>Drewser2001: oh yeah, we must succeed then<br>Owiber: yeah<br>Drewser2001: ok, so you write the program and I'll design the hardware<br>Owiber: think we need a physicist?<br>Drewser2001: for sure, that would important as we try to defy every natural law there is<br>Owiber: hmm...<br>Owiber: do you know a physicist?<br>Owiber: oh, I know what we can do<br>Owiber: assume we create a time machine and talk to Einstein about creating the time machine<br>Drewser2001: we can go to the future and find a better physicist that knows almost everything about time travel too<br>Owiber: oh, yeah<br>Drewser2001: wow, that'd make our lives easier<br>Owiber: we can create a time machine, then go into the future and steal the plans from ourselves<br>Owiber: perfect!<br>Drewser2001: yeah!!!<br>Owiber: and if we need money, we can go into the future and beg for change... once we get back, reverse inflation will make us rich<br>Drewser2001: we're brilliant<br>Owiber: oh man, this is awesome<br>Drewser2001: that it is<br>Drewser2001: we can't be stopped </content:encoded>

	<title>1:40AM Post</title>
	<content:encoded>Like the title suggests, I'm making (well, starting at least) this post at 1:40AM. Weee. I just watched a bunch of trailers on Apple's site and now I'm in a mode of "deep contemplation." The only thing is that I'm not sure what I'm contemplating about. =)  <br><br>Hmm... anyways, saw the Jersey Girl trailer again and thought that that looks like another movie you'd go to on a date.  Well, that lead me to Kevin Smith's <a href=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/jerseygirl/>online diary</a> on it and it seems like he thinks it's the best movie he's every made (although very different from his other movies). *shrug* Also found some movie that Stupid Blond Girl From 24 is in and... uhh... as VJ would put it, it looked pretty squirty. I love how that can mean both something really good and something really bad... and I'm not even going to clarify, so it'll be left as vague as ever.<br><br>School's not too bad yet, although I see the horrible onslaught of Chinese + multiple CS projects + tests + extracurricular activities + work eventually hammering at my head and state of "sanity."  So far, I've just got Chinese and Liquid website stuff... and that's not too bad.<br><br>It's always quiet in the room with just Sam and I.  We both have headphones on and are on our computers.  Samitucus or Samiticus, which spelling do you guys like better?<br><br>Uhhh... bathroom time.</content:encoded>

I liked the way they mixed the songs together... it was sad though. =(  Although, the only thing about watching movies like this is that I feel like I should have watched them with a girlfriend.

	<title>CMS Crazy</title>
	<content:encoded>So, I spent most of the day going through tons of <a href=http://www.opensourcecms.com/>CMS's</a> (thanks to Minix for link).  I think it's driving me crazy... but I think I may try e107 or PostNuke for the Liquid site.  Tried installing Tiki, but the Liquid server was being stupid and I couldn't upload the whole thing... so maybe I'll wait to try that one. I need to have a meeting with Karen sometime to finalize and/or redo the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/designs/liquid/04>Liquid layout</a>.<br><br>Hmm... also found out that I apparently changed my CHI506 class.  I have no clue when I did that, cause I thought I was in the earlier class as well.  Oh well... we'll see what happens. =)</content:encoded>

	<title>Canine Pics</title>
	<content:encoded>So... I uploaded some dog pictures to the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/albums>Picture Album</a>. Specifically, our new dog is <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/albums/?mode=view&album=Dogs%21&pic=IM004240.jpg&dispsize=800&start=0#albumtop>here</a> and <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/albums/?mode=view&album=Dogs%21&pic=IM004241.jpg&dispsize=800&start=0#albumtop>here</a>.</content:encoded>

	<title>New Dog</title>
	<content:encoded>So we got a new dog today and found out Orbit had a minor tumor on his tail that needs to be removed (which will be done by tomorrow morning I believe).  I'll get up pictures sometime... Oriana originally wanted to name the new dog Oink, but after seeing it... he doesn't really look like an Oink, so the name's in the air (although, it probably must start with the expected 'O' letter).  I suggest Orc Muncher or Orc Crusher.  I'm leaning towards Orc Muncher now... but the final decision's up to Oriana. =)</content:encoded>

	<title>TI Emulator</title>
	<content:encoded>Well, I just IM'ed Chad with this... but I'll go ahead and make a post about it too cause I seem to remember a few people being interested in it (Van? Andrew? I forget exactly who).  Anyways, I found a nifty TI emulator with images of the TI calculators too... I had to grab the ROMs off of another site (I'm guessing it's not all that legal to host the ROM images?)... but I got them and threw them into the emulator's ZIP file which I've uploaded <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/vti.zip>here</a>. Please don't report me to TI.<br><br>Ahem... to TI: I own a TI83 and have uploaded the ROM image to my website for backup purposes only. Please ignore the TI86.ROM file. Thanks. ;)</content:encoded>

	<title>Creature Tech</title>
	<content:encoded>Yesterday, Chad, Oriana and I went over to Dragon's Lair (Round Rock) while waiting for Nathan to get off work.  Chad bought a comic called Creature Tech which is pretty cool. The art and story and stuff is by Doug Tennapel who did Earthworm Jim and some FIF CD art... among other stuff.  Yeah, anyways... the art and story is pretty nifty so you guys should ask Chad to read it if you're interested.  Unless if he's paranoid you'll ruin it... which is likely. =P Heh, j/k.<br><br>I bought issue #2, #3, and #4 of Superman/Batman comics which seem pretty entertaining as well.  Ordered #1 off of eBay as a bunch of places are selling out of it.<br><br>Umm.. yeah... so finally, LAN party at Nathan's tonight. GO GO GO!</content:encoded>

Computer Networks - we're doing some neat stuff with actual real examples (ie. something called the Internet). Computer Graphics - OpenGL time!  Computer Architecture - the prof. worked at IBM and now at Intel... he helped with the G5 core and the maybe-soon-to-be Pentium 5.  Pretty neat.  Comp Arch looks like it'll be pretty fun too, it's the class I'm looking forward to the most.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>uhhh... so I was compiling KDE and OpenOffice.org-Ximian at the same time and I managed to use over 2GB up in the compilation of the two of those, which resulted in me using up 100% of that partition.

I think I know where to put some of that extra space....</content:encoded>

	<title>GIMP</title>
	<content:encoded>After a long while of abstaining from using GIMP because of it's horrible (well, IMHO) UI compared to Photoshop (okay, maybe that's just because I'm used to PS now)... I took a stab at 1.3.17 (the latest devel version), and I must say, I am VERY VERY impressed by how much they've improved it.<br><br>Now, they have a menu bar above the image, as well as the crazy right click menu, which is very helpful because I hated that right click thing (again, probably just used to Photoshop).  It didn't import my PSD's very nicely, but that's alright, just would have been a nice perk.  There are a few nice things missing (ie. preview on a lot of the filters/script-fu's) but it definately is getting there.<br><br>I'd say give it another few months and I may begin trying to use it instead of Photoshop for my designs.  GOOOOO (legally =) FREE SOFTWARE!</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>It's funny how I check OliverWEB to see if perhaps some updates were made when I know I haven't done anything. =)<br><br>I've been feeling a bit drained creativity-wise on things to talk about (err... as you can tell, for a while)... I'm not quite sure what happened.  I should like to have creative and fun things to talk about... hmmm...<br><br>However, I haven't been too drained graphics-design wise, which is thankful.  Now, I've got four websites in my "website queue" after finally finishing the <a href=http://www.youthwave.org>Youthwave</a> redesign. The liquid-missions, liquid (although Karen is handling most of the graphical design on that one), lighthouse, and John Mao's parents' restaurant. Hmmm... perhaps I'm going to overload myself. =/  An intern coordinater person at work asked me if I could make a website for her baby too... I'm not quite sure if I can handle all that...<br><br>On to work... well, first day flew by rather fast... some girls talked to Van and I about how they didn't recognize us at all even though they thought they knew everyone who interned last summer.  We realized that between Van, Tecuan, and I, we really did isolate ourselves from the rest of the interns... heh... oh well. =)<br><br>I actually was a bit productive today, got most of my accounts setup (except still need to find mail server name so  I don't have to use web interface) and learned quite a bit of python.  I believe my project this year is to help make a thin layer between one API to another... and perhaps make the thin layer go from C/C++ to Python.  I'm not entirely sure on the details, but it sounds interesting.<br><br>Well, that's all for today. Hope Andrew had a nice time on his first day at Sun too.  I know Van got stuck back into his old dept. Hehe... poor Van. ;)</content:encoded>

I would have been out of here 30+ minutes ago, but some girl just sent 45+ jobs to the printer... so I have to wait for her to get done before mine reaches the end of the queue. Ugh.  Oh, and the other printer is dead... I tried printing to that one until I noticed that the job at the front of the queue had been sitting there for three hours. Ugh Ugh Ugh.<br><br>Hmm... well that's all for now. Maybe I will sneak into the end of Automata and see if she handed out a quiz....</content:encoded>

	<title>Debian</title>
	<content:encoded>Ahhh... my leap into the world of Debian. Turned out much better than I expected!  I installed using my Knoppix CD, which made the whole process much easier! The HD install script didn't allow me to specify different partitions for different mount points, so I did that after the install was finished. I made a seperate partition for /home so that in future installs, I wouldn't have to kill it.<br><br>I'm just going to throw a few notes here now:<br><br>Antialias in Phoenix (installed from <a href=http://pryan.org/phoenix/>here</a>):<ul><li>userChrome.css and userContent.css - make sure it uses Luxi Sans or another antialiased font</li></ul><br><br>Konsole AA fonts:<ul><li>Just grabbed a ton of fonts from baghat and threw them in /usr/share/fonts. This messed up the default sans font though and made it look really ugly.</li><li>To fix that... see <a href=http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=37347&highlight=antialias>this Gentoo thread</a>. Basically, turn off hinting for sans fonts.</li></ul><br><br>Let's see... oh yeah, dhclient:<ul><li>Wait time was too long originally for dhcp. So: "apt-get install dhcp-client" installs dhclient, which worked quite well.  Edit /etc/dhclient.conf and edit timeout value.</li></ul><br><br>Alright, I think that's all I want to say for now. =)</content:encoded>

	<title>Knoppix</title>
	<content:encoded>So I stumbled upon Knoppix again (I think Van tried them out a little a while back). And while I was chatting with Mark, he discovered this neat little tib-bit of info from <a href=http://www.knoppix.net>Knoppix.net</a>:<blockquote><i>Knoppix 3.2 has now KDE 3.1 and "persistant home" - a way to save the configuration also on hd and USB-Memory-Sticks.</i></blockquote>So, I had this idea... you get one of <a href=http://www.meritline.com/minidvdr.html>these</a>, and one of <a href="http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProduct.asp?submit=manufactory&catalog=68&manufactory=1785&DEPA=1">these</a>, and you've got a really really awesome mobile custom OS in your pocket(s). Oh man, I'm not sure how, when or if I'll actually use it but the prospect of actually doing it is so cool I'm so very tempted........</content:encoded>

	<title>Tolkien</title>
	<content:encoded>Man, J.R.R. has to be one of the coolest dudes ever. I'm only half-way through LOTR, but I like it a lot. He just has a way of putting certain things into words (and by "words" I also mean the ones he made up =) to make it sound <i>cool</i>. I was talking to Mark and concluded that I would have very much liked to have hung out with Lewis and Tolkien (btw, what's with the initials? J.R.R, C.S.?) and smoked pipe with them in Oxford... even though that's probably what ended their lives.<br><br><i>Mithrander</i>... man, that's just so COOL. I don't know why I like it so much, but I think Tolkien's languages are really really spiffy. I, for one, would have no objection to this guy actually creating a real language for people to speak... it'd be the language of coolness. =)<br><blockquote><i>Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,<br>Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,<br>Nine for the Mortal Men doomed to die,<br>One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne<br>In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br>One Ring to Rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br>One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<br>In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.</i></blockquote><br>Argh, so cool!<br><br>I've decided my son's name is going to be Mithrandir...<br><br>Okay, fine... maybe just his middle name. ;)</content:encoded>

	<title>Trickery</title>
	<content:encoded>HAHA... I just wanted to write this down so it is recorded and I can remember it in days to come. =)  "Andrew" just played a FFA Warcraft 3 game versus Mark and Van... the tricky thing was, it actually wasn't Andrew, it was me. =) AND, it was unknown that it was me and I even tried to play like Andrew in the beginning to throw Mark off. Hehe. =)<br><br>Also, I made a "truce" with Mark knowing he thought it was Andrew (so I figured he'd definately leave him alone and go after Van since Andrew usually isn't as good as Mark or Van).  Van was NE so I figured he went mass ancients, which he did. =) The only thing I was scared of was Mark's raiders, but after hearing "man, we just killed each other" (or something like that) from the two of them, I knew that was my que. In go 15 fully upgraded steam tanks from my secret mass production facility to the north of my base and it was over. =)<br><br>Hehe, now I think Mark and Van are going to kick me tomorrow. =)</content:encoded>

	<title>Yesterday</title>
	<content:encoded>Went Christmas shopping yesterday with mostly Van... we drove all the way down to Barton Creek for mainly Cinnabons... hehe.... oh, we did get Megan's present there though.<br><br><b>Highlights:</b><blockquote>Van and I walked into 5-7-9 and some girl gave us some really weird looks...<br><br>We missed the Mopac exit off of 183, so we tried to make up for it by going on Lamar, then we took an exit here and an exit there, a turn here and a turn there... and ended up zig-zagging Lamar about 3 or 4 times or something like that<br><br>We missed the exit to go to Barton Creek, so I used my superior directional instinct to make the correct turns to get back to where we needed to go... =)<br><br>We got Nancy a good gift. =D<br><br>Chad's isn't bad either... hehe...<br><br>I thought about getting Viraj another cow calendar, but got cheep... ah well...</blockquote><br>K, I gotta get dressed...</content:encoded>

	<title>Story Time!!!</title>
	<content:encoded>Once upon a time, there lived a boy.  This boy really badly wanted to be a fisherman when he grew up.  He dreamt about it every night.  While he was awake, he would imagine plans for getting to such a high post.  One day, he told his father that he wanted to be a fisherman.<br><br>"Daddy!  I want to be a fisherman!"<br><br>His father groaned, and after a long pause, responded.  "Son... You know how I've always told you you could be anything you wanted to be, if you set your mind to it?"<br><br>"Oh yes daddy!"<br><br>"Well I lied... the truth is the world is a huge trap.  You grow up, you dream, your dreams get stuffed into your throat, and you're placed somewhere with just enough money to survive, and you're forced to stay there, because if you leave, you starve."<br><br>"No no daddy!  That's not true!" Shouted the little boy.  "I will be the exception!"<br><br>And the boy tried to be the exception, he did everything he could... but unfourtanetly, he didn't realize, that everyone else was also trying to be the exception... they all got trapped, including the ambitious little boy, and everyone went about their lives with their heads held low, pretending to be happy, but inside, knowing that they were nothing and unimportant.</content:encoded>

	<title>For: Oliver =) (Though everyone should read it...)</title>
	<content:encoded>Well, I'm bored... I actually just spent the past few minutes writing a rant for this page, but it seemed too pessimistic so I deleted it. Basically the gist was, I'm bored, this page needs more updates, I can now get through 20 comic strip sites in 20 minutes, and I have 3 hours to kill =) Pretty pointless. Like this! Only this is much shorter. Oliver would've killed me had I posted the other one. Oliver might kill me for posting this... but I don't believe he is that evil. Oliver has never struck me as an evil nor diabolical guy. Now I'm not saying Oliver strikes me as a sweet cute lovable huggable type guy either. Though I'm sure some people do think that. I wonder if Oliver would object to me putting a story about him on here... mind you, I have no obsession for Oliver... just... it's his site... and I'm bored. =)<br><br>Once there was a guy named Oliver, who coincidentally, had the last name Wong. Oliver liked his name, and took it with him everywhere he went. He liked his name so much, he started signing it to his papers, and on his checks, and debit slips. Pretty soon, other people started noticing Olivers name, and started calling him by it. After that, almost everyone that knew Oliver, knew him by his name. His name was a big success. Then Oliver made friends. But, due to backstabbing and treachery, he soon lost these friends. One such friend was Matthew Minix. Oliver told Matt that he would help him with a website, that they would both work on. Now, while Oliver said he would <i>help</i> Matt, he knew full well that he would be doing all the work on it himself. However, after Matt paid for the site, Oliver did nothing with it! He just let it sit there... which isn't to say he was totally heartless... he didn't make the site sit on the cold hard floor, but rather gave the site a <a href = "http://www.coconutcomics.com">chair</a> to sit on, and a little plant for shade, and to produce oxygen if the site so needed. But this simple act of kindness wasn't enough. The site felt empty, and Matt, having birthed the site, was saddened by Olivers almost complete surrender of the site to the harshness of the world known as cyberspace. Pretty soon, all of Olivers other friends began to notice his cruelty. And they all left him in the gutter to rot and decay. One such person was Van Nguyen. Van had long suspected Oliver of being an evil fiend of Satan, but being one himself, Van had never cared. But Van was sympathetic towards websites, being on a dial-up connection, he knew how fragile they were, and he appreciated each byte they entailed. When he saw the lack of attention Oliver had given CoconutComics.com Van screamed (Editors Note: He screamed like a little girl) he began to sob. After this, he could no longer look upon Oliver again. Another friend that abandoned Oliver, was named Chad Wilson. For a long time, Chad respected Oliver, as a person. But, Chad himself, was a racist.  One day before school began, Chad desperately needed a haircut. He asked Oliver to pay for a haircut which Oliver agreed to do (which btw, still gotta pay you back Oliver! Don't let me forget!!) After Chad's haircut, his hair was finally, for the first time in perhaps 3 years, above his eyes. Chad could see! He looked towards Oliver, and noticed that Oliver was chinese.  That was the last time Chad ever spoke to Oliver. (Except to borrow more money later) Even those friends that tried to make a friendship with Oliver work, he soon alienated. One such person, was Nancy Wong. Having the same last name as Oliver, everyone always assumed they'd get married. But, pretty soon, he took something very dear to Nancy. A toynapping if you will. He did this with the help of Van, who, at the time was still his friend. When Nancy discovered it was Oliver and Van who had taken her toy, she threw herself off of the UT Tower, only to be heard of once again, and that being when she hit the ground and mumbled an "Uh!" <br><br>At this point in his life, Oliver only had a few friends... none of which were close. Over time, these relationships faded as well. One friend, a guy named Brook, who ironically enough, had an aversion to saying the name Matt... tried with all of his heart to keep his relationship with Oliver... but it was not to be. One day, Brook's car broke down. The truth came out.  Oliver was only friends with Brook for his explorer. Another friend, Mark, stopped being friends with Oliver, after Olivers 427th attempt to get him to say "Polo" <br><br>At this point, Oliver became a recluce. Locking himself in his room, staring at the one thing that kept him whole. A poster of Josh Hartnett. He would every night, pray to the poster. Praying that the great Josh would come, and save him from his demise. But the posters ears were closed. A month after locking himself in his room, his two sisters, Olivia, and Oriana planned a trap for him. Oriana hid behind a crate, while Olivia snuck behind him. Olivia AWP'ed her brother, at a range of 800 pixels. <br><br>And so ended, the tragic life, of someones whose name, is now better left forgotten.<br></content:encoded>

	<title>A bleak day in posting</title>
	<content:encoded><i>She left me... She said it was best for both of us, that we were still young and we should see other people, explore new worlds, experience life and grow as individuals... She said she loved me, that she'll always love me no matter what. And maybe, just maybe, if we were meant to be, we'll find our way back to each other again... I just stood there, bawling. Then it was time for recess, so I steeled myself and went out to play kickball. The guys needed me. Even though I'd just been dumped, I couldn't let them down. I was usually the last one picked, but still a vital contributor off the bench. <br>Ah, third grade... I remember it well. </i><br><br>-Thanks to Sinfest.net for this joke =)</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Wellllll, the poll seems to be pretty one sided... and I think, if all of the regular visitors left that haven't voted voted for the same thing not coconutcomics.com, it still wouldn't make a difference =)  I'm going to register the domain and sign up for ADDR (web hosting service... the one Olivers using =)) sometime this week I believe.  Butttt!  First, I'm curious on who's interested in doing comics on this site.  I'm going to try not to force anyone into doing it by assuming... so I'm going to let you post yes/no here.  Of course, if in my head, I hope you do, if you don't post here or say no, I'm going to bug you incessantly for it...</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>It was brought to my attention that bitmaps (BMP) were used as image formats for some images. DO NOT USE BITMAPS!!! =) <br><br>Also, in the process of converting the bitmaps to JPEG and uploading them, I noticed a bunch of images that were just sitting there not being used. Please don't use the newsimages folder as a storage space. At least tell me if you put something in there temporarily so I can delete it...<br><br>And Minix, what program are you using to save JPEG's? They're bigger than they need to be...

	<title>My Day</title>
	<content:encoded>Well, I've been bored today, I had something I was supposed to do, but I couldn't concentrate on it... but, I was able to do a few random things.  I'm not going to bore you all with the details, if you're curious, ask =)  but, I have been drawing today, and... after awhile, decided the drawings I've done would make a really stupid comic!  I don't have a title, doubt it'll be around long enough to need a title, but, here are all three comics!  Why am I putting up the first two, when there are links below?  Bite me<br><br><a href = "http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/sorryoliver.jpg">#1: Remember...Amoeba's will take you seriously.</a><br><br><a href = "http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/ImMessedUp.jpg">#2: Racism is bad...</a><br><br><a href = "http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/charliebrown.jpg">#3: You can only push someone so far...</a><br><br><a href = "http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/oliversexycough.gif">#4: The Scariest thing I've ever seen.</a><br><br><a href = "http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/jurassic.jpg">#5: Don't worry, this is the last one.</a><br><br><a href = "http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/comicssuck.jpg">#6: Ahh, so that's why... bite me, you can survie another.</a><br><br>Yes, I am pathetic... and yes, you all still have to deal with me...<br></content:encoded>

	<title>Funny Story</title>
	<content:encoded>Hilo ^.^ I thought this was pretty funny.. I found it a little bit ago.. it's a story I wrote in 6th grade (I never finished it, thank goodness).. it's not that long (TG.. ;))... but it's really funny because... can anybody imagine Oliver or me like this? =D<br>***<br><br>In a far away galaxy, lived a young, beautiful princess. Her name was Oriana Wong. Her mother and father, the Queen and King, lived in the palace with her and ruled the country. Oriana wasn't alone though, true, she is the youngest of her family, but she had an older brother and sister named, Prince Oliver and the #1 princess Olivia. Here is the story of their lives.<br><br><i>For more, go to Comments ^.^</i><br></content:encoded>

	<title>New And Improved</title>
	<content:encoded>Don't get me wrong, I sorta liked the other animated gif of Olivia... despite it looking nothing like her, but... gotta make it better =)  this is the better one =) <br><center><br>(heh... accidentally overwrote it, will fix when I get home)<br></center><br>Not that bad... if you've known me long, (4 years)  you know I used to waste my life making stuff like this, this one is one of those I made back then (I think... heh, I made a lot... I think I made this one, I know I made one like it if not this one, theres a lot of them out there)<br><br>But obviously, since I made it a long time ago, it was not done with Olivia in mind, it looks *sorta* like her, but not really, I cant picture her in this outfit... but... well, it's better then the one I worked on today and last night, and its the closest I ever did =)  </content:encoded>

	<title>Lala =) Remember sheep?</title>
	<content:encoded>Do you all remember the old <a href = "http://www.oliverweb.com/boredom2/sheep/index.html">sheep</a> program that was featured on Oliverweb?  It was awhile ago... well I was looking at that program the other day, and I started thinking "You know what?  I could probably do something like that" I mentioned this to Olivia, and decided she should be the character walking around the desktop.  I started to work on it.  Lala, here is some preliminary (and sucky =)) art of Olivia walking =)  <br><center><br><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/lalabad.gif"><br></center><br><br>Seems to be walking really quickly huh?  Well thats because the shareware anim-gif creator I downloaded, had no delay option... and I was too lazy to go find another one, in the program, I'll be able to slow it down very easily, and it will look tons better =)<br><br>I just want to say something to Oliver now =)  <br><br><center><i>bite me =)</i></center><br><br>If anyones curious, thats my response to him, before he gives me another <a href = "http://www.oliverweb.com/chats/om6.shtml">"melody minix"</a> comment =)<br><br>I'm trying to think of some things for her to do, like the sheep would whimper, eat flowers, etc.  Please give suggestions =)  Also, I'm trying to decide if I should make her, fall towards the bottom of the screen, like a gravity thing, or if I should allow her to walk around the desktop, as if it were a flat surface, please, give me feedback!</content:encoded>

I'm thinking about switching over to it from "WabbaMan"... what you think? I just like change I suppose, and "Owiber" sounds goofy, so seems like a decent candidate. =)<br><br>I'm even gettin tired of OliverWEB's layout a little... couple more months and I might change it again, I think I'm going to go back to black background... or at least a dark color...<br><br>Alright, back to "work" now. =)</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Bravo man... really, I "applaud" you. You've been successful in deleting a few quotes and memories from OliverWEB. Great job, really. I don't know if I could have done it better myself.<br><br>I could just email this to you, but I know you'll read it here. I've got nothing to hide, perhaps you do? I could very well go through every strand of OliverWEB and take off every reference of you... how would you like that? I won't... I'll be the bigger man right now. I won't lower myself to your level. Getting pissed yet? You have a problem with that. Read on. Perhaps you should think through things a bit more before you actually do things. That's a novel idea, <i>think</i>. Wow. <br><br>You need help man, I'm sorry... I don't think I can anymore. Perhaps you've forgotten all the times I've tried. After all this, do you still not see clearly, are you still all tangled up in your pride? Wow, you're 18 now... that makes you a man, right? Yeah, just like how wearing that black belt makes you a super cool martial arts dude. Let me tell you something. And make sure you listen and understand, because you've probably had some trouble thinking lately. It means <i>nothing</i>. Nothing at all. Think you're a man? Can handle your own life? Deep within, you're not a man, you're a whining little brat foul mouthing every person around him because things didn't go your way.<br><br>Stop trying to control people... you can't, you won't, and you'll only end up screwing your own life up while hurting others in the process. Am I pissed right now? Yes. Another congratulations to you man, you got Oliver mad. Few have been able to achieve that task. That make you the best? The smartest dude ever? Give me a break. You didn't even "hack" into OliverWEB. You *knew* my quote page password... that's smart thinking there, let me tell you. You broke a trust, have I ever broken a trust to hurt you?<br><br>Perhaps you weren't the one who messed with the page? Let's look into this, shall we? You knew my password. It was a few days/hours (I don't know, I was in Dallas) after I erased your account(s) on OliverWEB, so you have a motive. "To each his own..." has you written all over it. Perhaps it wasn't you? No, scratch that idea. <br><br>I urge you to look within yourself and see how truly twisted you are right now. There's a song that goes "humble thyself in the sight of the Lord"... maybe you've sung it before? You should listen to the words from your own mouth. Really, you should. I said I was mad, but do I hate you? No, I will never hate you no matter what you do. I am sorry for you, I'm sorry our friendship has gotten to become like this, I'm sorry there <i>is no friendship</i> anymore.<br><br>May God be with you and open your eyes. You'll need Him.<br><br>-To the others reading this, please don't add any "scolding" in the comments. Let this be.</content:encoded>

	<title>An interesting tidbit</title>
	<content:encoded>Lala, and now, something from the Bible... (sorry for the language... other bible in car... and this ones kind of old)<br><br>OK, oldest guy in the bible... was Methuselah who lived to 969 years old... how do you think he died?  I would guess... Old age... but...<br><br>Genesis 5:26  "And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty and nine years: and he died"<br><br>his son, Lemach was born when Methuselah was 187<br><br>Genesis 5:25 "And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech"<br><br>and then, Lemach had a son, Noah<br><br>Genesis 5:28-29 "And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son, (29) and he called his name Noah.<br><br>Genesis 7:6 "And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth"<br><br>lala... 187+182+600 = 969... which means that Methuselah either died the year of the flood, or in the flood... <br><br>Pretty cool I thought =)<br></content:encoded>

	<title>Memorable Moments</title>
	<content:encoded>Was looking through the quote archives... just thought I'd throw some of the quotes up here for fun. =)<blockquote><i>"Yes, my Hard Drive is being used up at a constantly increasing rate no thanks to your no good scum sucking emails so if you don't mind, then STOP GIVING ME THOSE !#$%!!$! THINGS!!!!!! Ahem, if you see me in the halls next year you better either run real fast or else smash yourself into the brick wall and save me the trouble, okay? Oh yeah, have a nice day." -Van<br><br>"I AM YODA!!!!" -Olivia<br><br>"Backstreet Boys and NSync are almost exactly alike, I don't know how people can say one is better than the other. Personally, I like NSync better." - "Anon"<br><br>"stupid Sarah " -Oliver<br><br>"If I were a fruit, I'd like to be one with pink tights and fake boobys like you see on 6th street." -Chad<br><br>"Hey, is that Santa Claus? He gives me lovely presents, just like my furry easter rabitts hand out eggs, to iraq got bombed today in a series of star wars is a bad movie" -Minix<br><br>"Stuff that not mean we think was stuff that was we dont" -Minix<br><br>LASSIE'S A BLONDE TOOOOOOO! yay!!!! " -Sarah</i></blockquote><br>Well, those are a few that stood out for now... I'd just like to note that a lot of Minix's quotes seem like random words just thrown in there and make no sense at all. =) Speaking of quotes, I think I'm goin to redo the whole random quote generator thing up there... hasn't had a revamp in a year or so. =)</content:encoded>

	<title>A question...</title>
	<content:encoded>Alright, at District this weekend, there were two girls competing in HI and DI... (Humourous Interp and Dramatic Interp)  the definition for how judges should rate contestants, is based on their voice inflections in conveying the message of the piece... the two girls are deaf, and can't speak... <br><br>NFL stated that they couldn't compete, because of the rules... so they sued the NFL, and had a federal court hearing on it...<br><br>Because of this, HI and DI are now postponded for almost a month... <br><br>what are your opinions on this?<br><br>personally, my feelings are, that while I'm impressed that they want to compete, and I wont deny the importance of humourus and dramatic acting for deaf people... I don't think they should be competing at a speech tournament... I'm going to quote Brian... "You don't see people in wheelchairs suing to play football."  <br><br>Maybe I'm just being a jerk... but the fact is, judges can't understand their pieces, but certainly wont give them last out of pity... <br><br>Please share...</content:encoded>

	<title>Matt's Time To Vent!</title>
	<content:encoded>I hope this doesn't annoy anyone, but no one is online, and I need to complain. =)<br><br>First... I hate stereotypes... I hate how some people will label an entire group based on one person.  For example someone saying that all christians hate gays, and have no fun... I like to think I have fun, and I have never hated anyone... I dislike people who say that all "blacks/crackers/etc are stupid."  or any other generalization like that... it just annoys me...<br><br>Second... I hate how people create these stereotypes... how there are some people who claim to be christians and then go out and kill people who are gay to "prove" it.  Or how people who are christians insist that other christians only listen to christian music, because all other music is from the devil...  UGH!  heh... ok, I think I'm done...<br><br>Thank you for listening to me rant...</content:encoded>

	<title>Kickin' it in the hizouse on the west saiyeed</title>
	<content:encoded>^that's eubonics...or however you spell that...or should I say <i>spizznell</i>?  Hardy har har.  Anyway....I decided that since i haven't put in any kind of news in a while, that I should.  So that's what's going on.  Having fun yet?  I thought so.  Well, I suppose I'll tell you what's going on in Wes's Life.<br><br>Last night, two of my friends and I went to downtown Fort Worth in my redneck rig(my truck).  Sitting in the back were a bunch of instruments and my friend Josh...just to make sure nothing flew out or got jacked while we sat at a red light.  We drove around forever, trying to find a corner where we could park and unload and stuff, but we couldn't...then we pulled up to this stoplight, and my friend Cliff hopped out and grabbed a guitar and ran to a corner.  Then the other guy, Josh, and I drove around for eternity trying to find somewhere close by to park.  Finally, we parked at another red light right by the corner Cliff had claimed, and they unloaded the truck with blinding speed that would shame superman!  Then I went to a parking garage and proceeded up, then foolishly drove in the same circle for about five minutes before realizing that I had seen one car in particular about three times already...I felt positively stupid.  Well, I finally parked and grabbed the bass guitar that was in there, and went to the corner, recieving a Christian track thingy on the way that said "Are You a Survivor?" like the show...  Well anyway I got to the corner, and we set up and started by playing "Friends in Low Places," and a couple more, and then....a cop came and told us to quiet down.  Someone in the apartmets across the street had complained.  Darn.  So we went acoustics, but the drummer couldn't hear me, so I hooked up to the little amp, and we played quite quietly, gaining about four bucks because we so good, and then....lo and behold here came the cop.  Darn.  So they began packing up, and I walked to the parking garage a few blocks away, then right as I had gotten up three flights of stairs, then walked one level up, I checked my pockets, and.....<B>NO KEYS!!!  WHERE ARE MY KEYYYS!?!?!  I JUST WALKED FOR TEN MINUTES TO GET HERE AND I HAVE NO KEYS!!!!</B> <i>Okay....calm....deep breaths...let's just calm down...there must be some way out of this nasty situation....  </I> Then, I remembered something.  I reached deep into my pockets, and I fished around a bit, pulled out my wallet, and opened it, only to discover.....*triumphant music*  KEYS!!! I always keep a spare set of keys in my wallet for events JUST LIKE THIS!!! YYAYAYAAAAAAAAYYYY!!!  Well, the rest is really quite inconsequential.  I went to the corner, we packed up, drove around for a parking space, for the garage thing was absolutely out of the question, then we went into a lot, right as someone was leaving, and spent a looong time trying to pack a big amplifier, a bass drum, three toms, two snares, four cymbals, a small amp, a head, and three guitars into the cab of my truck so they wouldn't be stolen by the evil folk of downtown.  Good thing too, because it started raining later...Well, when it began raining, we ran into this place called the Coffee Haus, where I got a root beer, Josh got a Dr. Pepper, and Cliff got their strongest coffee drink:  Rocket Fuel, into which he placed about 8 chocolate-covered espresso beans, and about 12 packets of sugar(and it was so strong that even after all that sugar, it was still incredibly bitter and coffee-tasting).  He did not sleep that night.  Well, we played some chess, and then the nice employees to which we are eternally grateful granted us some trash bags to cover our equipment with when we moved it to the back of my truck.  All in all, I'd say it was a pretty good night, which I enjoyed quite a bit.  I will do this again next friday, but this time, we'll get a permit to play guitar and drums and All Manner of Things on the street corner.  <br><br><br>Sorry that this is so long...I don't have anywhere else to put it...however, as an apology, here is a sandwich!!!<br><center><img src="http://hometown.aol.com/holyyam/images/eat the sammich.jpg"></center></content:encoded>

	<title>We Be Geeks!</title>
	<content:encoded>Oliver and I have been having a theoretical discussion on the quote page now for a little while, and so far no one but us has contributed.  Admittedly, it's kind of far down the page, and no one really looks down there, but underneath Wes's quote, about hoping all the guys on AIM would stop talking to her whatever, we've had this conversation<br><br><br><blockquote><i><br>Christine:  lol, point taken, Wes =P but... still Olivia's quote was an original one that you "copyrighted"... i mean plagarized? no wait never mind =P<br><br>Minix:  It would be plagiarized, but in reality, I think its Olivia that plagirized it from Wes... she got a time machine... *prepares for the philosiphical conversation thats bound to come*<br><br>Oliver: Woah... it would probably be theoretical not "philosiphical", Matt. =) But I'll spare you all this time... =) <br><br>Minix: Theoretical, whatever =) Well I'll do it instead. If she went to the future to copy the quote that Wes did, after getting the idea from Olivia, it would create sort of an infinite loop... or no quotes would show up in the first place, which creates a new dilemma... how many times in our lives, do we go into the future in a time machine, in hopes of finding something to copy, but we don't actually do anything because theres nothing to copy, because people that we were going to copy were copying what we were going to copy? Huh? huh? Interesting thought huh? =)<br><br>Oliver: Here's my theory... there's a relatively popular theory that if a time machine was ever created, it could never go back in time before it was actually invented... assuming that is true, I think that once a time machine is invented, that VERY VERY chaotic things will start happening and the Earth will soon have a TON of people on the planet from different time periods in the future, all of whom are traveling farthest in the past that is possible. Which may lead to the demise of mankind because the Earth cannot sustain that many humans... but then.. if all those people die or the relatives of those people die, how would they get there in the first place?... oohhh... ahh... Oh, and I think that according to that theory, that once the last screw (or whatever =) is attached to the time machine, that the inventor will know it worked because instantly at that point, people or at least one person will "teleport" into that room/area from a different time period. Cool, huh? =) <br><br>Minix: What if they went back into time, and killed the proffessor, and blew up the time machine?<br><br>Oliver: Then a vortex will appear and suck up all of existance into it. God would turn to Jesus and say "did we really make them in our image? they're not too bright... what is this, the 50 billionth time we had to do this?" Jesus will say "yeah, but they're cute little things running all over the place. Gotta love em." So they'll reset time and make one of the screws in the time machine malfunction so it never worked... =)<br><br>Minix: Ah... I see... so you're saying a time machine would be impossible to make?<br><br>Oliver: Lol, maybe... I really don't know. =) although there's some theoretical stuff that says even if you went back in time, there would be some kind of thing stopping you from changing it... I dunno, I saw it on TLC or the Discovery channel once =)<br><br>Minix: hmm... could you touch stuff, it just wouldn't effect anything?  <br></blockquote></i><br><br><br><br>and that's where we're at now.  We need help!  Someone else contribute!<br><br></content:encoded>

	<title>Another post by!!! ME!</title>
	<content:encoded>Am I the only one posting anymore?  Gosh... 3 in a row...  OK, I would like to assure everyone, that there is room to hope for the American public... Olivers rating, with time, eventually went down to a 7... still beating me by .1, but he no longer has the highest rating... Olivia's picture holds that one so far with a 7.3(?).   But fear not!  This picture rating sham is not yet over!  As there will still be pictures to rate!  =)  hehe, if you want one put up there, let me know!  I know some people deathly dont want me to either, if you dont, let me know too... just in case I forget =)<br><br>BTW... on Olivers rating... statistically speaking, there is a margin of error... I figure it to be about 70% (ha!  that math is wrong)  with a group of only 300 and not even random!  so i figure he deserved a zero... but thats just my opinion =)  sorry Oliver =)  ook!  tata!</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>I thouroghly enjoy admitting that I should be prepared to take a Government exam, but quite unfortunately, am not.  Perhaps, through the possibilities of statistics (I can randomly guess, yet still get an "A"), it won't be all too terrible.  I very much encourage you all to encourage me as I strive to overcome this frightfully intimidating ordeal.  Despite the fact that should you encourage me I will not receive it until after I have taken the exam, your encouragement is ultimately extremely important to me.  Thanks a bunch guys.</content:encoded>

	<title>Comment on this, Blockheads!</title>
	<content:encoded>Once upon a time, there was a poor young soul who inadvertently named himself "Blockhead." This resulted in many people calling him "Blockhead," for they believed in calling a person by their name. <br><script language="JavaScript">var bla=new String(window.location); if (bla.search("main") != -1){ document.write("<br><a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/chad>Click here</a> to read the rest!<"); document.write("!--"); }</script>Blockhead did not thoroughly enjoy being labeled "Blockhead," whereas this would have a mildly offensive effect on any person who was called such. So, Blockhead was on a mission. It was of utmost importance that his name transformed into something other than "Blockhead." How he was going to bring about this transformation, he had no idea, because the first time he named himself, it was an accident, much like when you crash into a parked car going 10000 mph with no intention of doing so. Blockhead starts with the basics: he calls his local city hall and asks the secretary how he should go about changing his name. Upon partially listening to Blockhead's question, the secretary claims that a person should be proud of the name he or she so fatefully owns, and never go about changing it. Blockhead decides that people related to areas of politics should not let personal influences guide them in their work, and then he moves on to his second plan: surreptitiously changing his name and leaving all other parties unaware of the change. <i>By leaving them out in my name change, surely they will see how I despise them for calling me "Blockhead"</i>, thought Blockhead. Unfortunately, Blockhead did not think this strategy all the way through, for everybody was not taken aback at his exclusive actions, and nor did they cease to poke fun at him. It is about this time that Blockhead meets Boobface, and decides his name isn't so bad after all. From that point forward, he survives a confident life until he dies.<br><br><center>The End</center><br><script language="JavaScript">if (bla.search("main") == -1){ document.write("<"); document.write("!--"); }</script>--></content:encoded>

It's great!  Today however, we got my favorite fan email so far...  <br><br><blockquote><i>Wow, not what I expected, but very funny!  I hit play at my desk at work and was diving for the speaker volume as our CFO was walking by, looking very suspiciously at my PC.  <br>"What the heck is that?" he said. <br>"I'm not sure, but they're from Austin" I replied.  <br>"Oh" he mumbled.  "Is that really Pat Buchanan?" he asked. <br>"I don't think so" I replied. <br>He went back to his office.  I don't think I'll see him near my desk for the rest of the day.  For that alone I owe you guys a big thanks<br> <br>Greetings to Austin from my dark corner cubicle in New York<br><br>Fred</i></blockquote><br><br><br>If you're confused, we recorded a track called Buchanans Concession Speech about the elections... it was me talking, not Buchanan.  He admitted defeat, and well, its pretty funny.  If you want to hear it sometime, tell someone, we'll try and figure out a way you can.<br><br></content:encoded>

	<title>Stuff Page</title>
	<content:encoded>Well, I went ahead and opened up the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/>StUfF directory</a> so you guys can see all the files in there... I mainly did this because I get too lazy to update the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/stuff.shtml>StUfF page</a>. So now, whatever I dump in there, you guys can see. Although if you go to the "StUfF" link on the sidebar, you'll go to the page.  I may throw in some surprises every once in a while... you never know. =)</content:encoded>

	<title>Dear Diary</title>
	<content:encoded>Dear Diary,<blockquote>I mean Journal, sorry.  What's up? I'm at work right now and I'm bored. I'm going to write you a story, k? Ok. Here goes. Once, there was this rabbit and it hopped all around and around, until one day it could hop no more.  What happened? I don't have the slightest idea. Then a worm came and poked the rabbit's foot.  The worm hopped away. Then a bear came and ate the rabbit, but the rabbit wasn't digested, it just teleported out of the bear's stomach. The bear got really confused as to why he was hungry again so fast so he bit his hand, but he didn't eat it because that would be bad. Then one day, the sun rose and the moon set. ThEnd.</blockquote>Cool huh, did you like that Dia...Journal? Good night. ZZzzzzzz... !!!!! Oh! I'm at work, I can't do that...</content:encoded>

	<title>More Satirical Content</title>
	<content:encoded>Well, found some more satirical (am I spelling that right?) news at <a href=http://www.satirewire.com target="_blank">SatireWire</a>. Here's a funny little nerd "news-brief":<blockquote><i>Cupertino, Cal. (SatireWire.com) - Symantec issued an                     apology to Microsoft yesterday after the security                     software maker's AntiVirus Research Center issued an                     alert for a "widespread and lethal virus known to cause                     system crashes and data loss" that turned out to be the                     Windows 2000 operating system. Symantec CEO John                     Thompson called it a "regrettable but understandable"                     mistake.</blockquote></i>Hehe... and since I have a couple of blondes visiting this site... no, this news is not real.  It is <i>fake</i>. =) Check out <a href=http://www.satirewire.com target="_blank">SatireWire</a> for more news, most of it is for the 'tech-people'... for other kinds of satirical news, go to <a href=http://www.bbspot.com target="_blank">BBSpot</a>.</content:encoded>

	<title>Time for my more links!</title>
	<content:encoded>Well, been keeping up to date with the news in our world at work and game up with these. <blockquote><i>Los Angeles, CA - Teen pop sensation Britney Spears whose hits "Oops I Did It Again" and "Baby, One More Time" is recovering today in a Los Angeles hospital after her breasts exploded while filming her latest video.   Three other people were treated for minor injuries.</blockquote></i>Hmmm... yeah... read the <a href=http://bbspot.com/News/2000/5/britney_oops.html target="_blank">rest</a>.  <br>It also seems like that Microsoft trial has made an unexpected turn...<blockquote><i>Redmond, WA - Microsoft today filed papers in Federal District Court alleging that the United States Government is a monopoly.  The papers allege that the current government has stifled competition, and has prevented innovation in government, by using its monopoly power to pass laws prohibiting the formation of another Federal government.</blockquote></i>Uh... that was very surprising, eh?

	<content:encoded>First off, I just found out why my scanner was scanning in pictures weird. I thought it was just that it was cheap. It's actually because I never calibrated it. Doh. Doh. Doh! Anyways, the calibrated scanner scanned four of the new pics (the ones on page <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/23/index.shtml>23</a>). I've added three pages for now, pages <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/21/index.shtml>21</a> to 23.

	<title>I gotta present for ya!</title>
	<content:encoded>Hehehe... ok, not a present, a problem... I just thought it'd be fun to quote Tanya there... Okay, here's a <a href=http://www.chessbase.com/puzzle/lang_eng.htm target="new">chess problem</a> I got from <a href=http://www.chessbase.com target="new">ChessBase</a>. It seems simple, but dang... it's hard! Here's the problem in one sentence:<i><blockquote>A game begins with 1.e4 and ends in the fifth move with knight takes rook mate.</blockquote></i>Here's an image of the starting position:<p><center><img src=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/chess.gif width=150 height=150></center><p>BTW, there's a prize if you're the first one to get it. See <a href=http://www.chessbase.com/puzzle/lang_eng.htm target="new">ChessBase</a> for details... of course, by the time you see this, it probably has been figured out.</content:encoded>
