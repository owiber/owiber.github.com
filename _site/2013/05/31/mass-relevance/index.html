  <p>Dang, blog. Sorry it&#39;s been so long. =)</p>

<p>I was holding off on mentioning this because there was so much I wanted to talk about, but I&#39;ll just go ahead and throw it out there and if there&#39;s anything else for me to say, I&#39;ll do it another time. =p After about 6.5 years at Bazaarvoice, I&#39;m off to <a href="http://www.massrelevance.com">Mass Relevance</a> starting July 1. BV&#39;s been such a great experience filled with lots of opportunity for me that it&#39;s bittersweet to say goodbye. The team I&#39;ve been on for the past year-ish has been awesome and I&#39;d be lucky to experience that type of passion, camaraderie, and teamwork in the future. I&#39;ll miss you guys!</p>

<p>That said, it&#39;s time I start a new adventure, so I&#39;m headed to MR where I&#39;ll have the benefit of working with a lot of ex-BVers who I think highly of. If they switch to first.last email addresses before I get there I&#39;ll be very sad! ;)</p>

<p>I added more to my nerd XP by going to a Magic draft with Jonney on Wednesday. Despite drafting what I thought was the worst deck I&#39;ve ever drafted, I got second place with it, so that&#39;s good I guess. I&#39;ve always thought that Magic was a game I could be really competitively good at if I wanted to invest the time into it and &quot;go pro&quot; despite how silly that sounds (hey, some of the <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=protour/default/prizes">prizes</a> are no joke though). =) That said, I don&#39;t know if I can handle playing it for days straight.</p>
