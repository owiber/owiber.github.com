  <p>Dang, it&#39;s August already. There&#39;s a lot of moving going on (or about to be). Unless delayed again, it&#39;s looking like to move to Mueller at the end of September and Olivia and Garrick are going to San Francisco. I don&#39;t mind another reason to go back to visit that city. =) We checked out the new Mueller HEB&#39;s cafe their opening weekend and it was decent enough. I could see myself talking a walk there with Mozilla frequently, especially once the weather isn&#39;t so scorching. Viraj and I have some tentative plans to get wasted there cause it&#39;d be hilarious.</p>

<p>Ryan&#39;s decided to take a gig at Mozilla, which is pretty sweet for him, but it&#39;s unfortunate that my time working with him again will only be 1.5 months. =p  Right before I started at MR, I took a trip to San Francisco to do some hanging out with recent ex-coworkers and just chill. In a rare occurrence, I decided not to take my DSLR and man did it make a difference walking around. I felt so much lighter! I don&#39;t think this means I won&#39;t bring it with me on future trips, but I&#39;ve pics of SF enough and plan on coming back many times in the future, so I figured I&#39;d be lazy. Here are some randoms from my iPhone though:</p>

<p>Coffee time:

<p>My parents used to own an ice cream shop around this area and I have multiple baby pics here. Always fun to return, and this time there was actually water running:

<p>More childhood nostalgia:

<p>Love this stuff:

<p>Oriana recently got the dogs some cow hoof to chew on at Andrew&#39;s suggestion and this resulted in the first time I&#39;ve had to break up a Mozilla and Badger fight. I&#39;m pretty sure Badger started it, but maybe I&#39;m biased. =) They&#39;re normally pretty good though:

<p>This past Friday I went to Town Lake (yes, I&#39;ll still call it that) with the MR crew for their &quot;fantastic friday&quot; and took Mozilla along with me. He spent a decent amount of time looking at some large turtles:
