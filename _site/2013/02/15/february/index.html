  <p>Happy post-Valentine&#39;s Day, yos! All you single people complaining, just shut your yappers and do something productive. ;)</p>

<p>Hopefully this isn&#39;t the only post I end up making this month, but I&#39;m finding it hard to come up with topics I can talk about here.</p>

<p>I ended up buying some <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=mjna">MJNA</a> stock a little while back and it&#39;s been doing well. I didn&#39;t really buy enough to make any significant dent one way or the other, but it&#39;s fun to say I&#39;ve made money buying/sell marijuana. =p</p>

<p>Beautiful Creatures came out recently and Oriana has been driving me crazy just <em>begging</em> me to take her. Something about a yearning in her loins or something. So weird. Yesterday, I caught her combing her hair looking at yourself in the mirror whispering &quot;you&#39;re a beautiful creature.&quot; I may have to give in and take her or I may find myself asleep forever.*</p>

<p>My Volt has been pretty satisfactory so far. The air dam at the front of the car is super low to the ground and it scrapes every so often whenever I go through various inclines. Supposedly it&#39;s built to withstand that type of thing and it&#39;s expected, but it&#39;s mildy annoying. The central panel controls are also annoying, most of them not being actual buttons. That said, I have yet to visit a gas station after going over 1200 miles (I still have about half a tank left). It&#39;s not really fair, but looking at gas alone, I&#39;ve probably done something like 280MPG. ;) I did end up doing the calculation for how much fully charging the car costs, and during this time of the year it&#39;s about $0.65, which gets me about 37 miles. So if I do the miles per dollar calculation, it&#39;s probably something in the ballpark of 36 miles per $1. FYI, during the summer, I expect a full charge to be about $1. Honestly, I&#39;m not sure if it makes sense to buy the Volt purely based on the travel cost savings, but it&#39;s a fun metric to look at.</p>
